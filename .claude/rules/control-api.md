## Control API

- `agtermctl` drives app/store actions over a local Unix socket. One-shot commands and polled
  `events.read` are in scope; terminal-output streaming is not.
- `agtermCore` owns protocol types, target/socket resolution, and host-free dispatch.
  `ControlServer` owns the socket and app-side effects; blocking accept/read runs off-main and requests
  hop to the main actor. SwiftPM `agtermctlKit` owns ArgumentParser and `SocketClient`.
- New commands are dispatcher-first (#78). `ControlDispatcher` owns parsing, validation, error text, and
  response shape; `ControlActions` supplies resolution and effects. Nil falls through only for unmigrated
  commands. Never add validation to the fallback switch.
- Every change needs protocol/round-trip types, dispatcher and app action, CLI, and dispatcher/CLI/e2e
  tests. State writes also need tree/window read-back, nil omission tests, and population coverage.
- An action whose only effect is a system-pasteboard write gets no control command. The socket never
  writes the user's clipboard — `session copy` returns the selection so it does not have to,
  `session paste` reads it as input — and returning the value instead duplicates what `tree` carries.

## Installation and agent integrations

- Xcode's CLI phase builds Release, copies/signs `agtermctl`, then deep re-signs the app; shallow signing
  fails with `agterm.debug.dylib`. The Help installer links into `/usr/local/bin`, directly or through one
  admin prompt. Host-free `CLIInstall` owns paths/quoting; app code owns filesystem/auth.
- Agent Hooks installation copies generic, Claude, Codex, Pi, OpenCode, and shell assets under
  `~/.config/agterm/agent-status`, baking the bundled CLI. Marker merges are idempotent and preserve
  unrelated config; unreadable config is never treated as absent.
- Claude maps prompt/tool work to `active --blink`, Stop to `completed --auto-reset`, and permission
  prompt to blocked. PostToolUse clears a prior block because there is no answer event.
- Codex maps SessionStart idle; prompt/pre/post tool active; Stop ending `?` blocked, otherwise completed.
  `PermissionRequest` is insufficient under Auto Review, so a pane watcher reads `session.text` and blocks
  only for visible approval/question UI. Remove stale issue #193 `codex-notify.sh` values, not comments or
  foreign notifiers.
- TOML merging refreshes managed markers while preserving trust tables. Leave foreign markers, existing
  user hooks, and invalid TOML untouched; show manual instructions for the last two. Require `/hooks`
  review for command-hook changes.
- Every install-result alert line stays ONE LINE and embeds no generated block; two or three sentences on
  that line are fine, and `AgentHooksInstallerTests` pins exactly that. `NSAlert` sizes itself to fit
  `informativeText` with no scroll and no height cap, so embedding the hooks block grew the window past the
  bottom of the screen (#430) — the block's long `command =` lines wrap several times each in that narrow
  column. The two manual-merge cases open `site/docs.html#codex-hooks-manual` through a second button
  instead, `informativeText` being plain unselectable text that renders no link. Keep the button second so
  OK stays the default and Return still dismisses. That docs section carries a copy of `codexHooksBlock`
  and drifts from it silently.
- Install Pi only when `~/.pi/agent` exists. Start is active; settle only after retries, compaction, and
  queued continuations. Pi exposes no reliable blocked event, so never infer it from prose.
- Install OpenCode only when its config exists; v1 exports only `AgtermStatusPlugin`, as the legacy loader
  treats every export as a plugin. Busy/retry and replies are active; asked permission/question is blocked.
  Latch a busy terminal error across sibling idle. Skip abort; defer ContextOverflow until idle unless busy
  resumes. Ignore deprecated `session.idle`.
- OpenCode v2 uses a separate dependency-free CLI entrypoint, `plugins/agterm-v2/tui.js`, with its own marker.
  Install the detected major, offering a choice or skip when unknown.
  Status follows the client's selected session and descendants; lifecycle details live in the plugin and its tests.
- Preserve unmarked Pi/OpenCode files and require restart or reload. Host-free `AgentHooksInstall` owns
  merge, marker, backup, and optional-agent policy.
- Skill installation targets every existing Claude/Codex skill root, creating Claude only when neither
  exists. Refuse an unmarked `SKILL.md`. The sole source is `plugins/agterm/skills/agterm/` with
  `SKILL.md`, references, examples, cookbook, troubleshooting, and `scripts/show-image.sh`. The whole
  directory copies verbatim, so a new file ships automatically — but the loader opens only what `SKILL.md`
  routes to, so a file added without a `description`/`when_to_use` trigger and a body pointer is dead
  weight.
- `show-image.sh` opens a PTY overlay and emits chunked kitty APC/base64. Pinned Ghostty has no OSC-1337
  or sixel, agent stdout escapes controls, and tool shells lack `/dev/tty`. Resolve relative to the loaded
  skill; hardcoded install paths and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` fail across app/plugin copies.
- Bundle the leaf at `Contents/Resources/agterm`. Claude uses array
  `skills: ["./skills/agterm"]`; Codex uses string `skills: "./skills/"`; the marketplace shapes differ.
  Keep plugin root `plugins/agterm` to avoid copying the roughly 21 MiB repository.
- Release bumps all three manifest versions and stops for commit because caches key on version.
  App-installed and plugin skills may coexist as `agterm` and `agterm:agterm` with undefined precedence.

## Transport and addressing

- Resolve socket from `AGTERM_CONTROL_SOCKET`, then `<AGTERM_STATE_DIR>/agterm.sock`, then Application
  Support. CLI `--socket` overrides. Explicit short paths avoid Unix `sun_path` near 104 bytes. Use 0600.
- Each connection sets `SO_NOSIGPIPE` and a 5-second receive timeout. Close on non-EINTR read failure,
  including EAGAIN. Start is idempotent and logs bind failure without blocking launch.
- `ControlServer.init` takes an exclusive non-blocking `flock` on `<socketPath>.lock`, and start refuses
  to bind while another process holds it. Ownership is decided at INIT, not at start: the launch window's
  surfaces are built during the initial render pass and snapshot `AGTERM_SOCKET` into the pty environment,
  while start runs from the scene's `.task` afterwards, so deciding there would hand the first shell the
  owner's live socket. Start retries acquisition for the instance refused while the owner was still alive,
  guarding on the held fd first — flock is per open file description, so re-opening a file this process
  already locked conflicts with itself. Nothing on disk distinguishes a live socket from a
  force-quit leftover, and unlinking a live one strands its owner: it keeps its listening fd, never
  learns, and only a restart recovers it. Do NOT probe with `connect` instead — on Darwin a live listener
  whose backlog is full refuses with the same `ECONNREFUSED` a socket nobody listens on returns, so one
  stalled client parking the serial accept loop would make a running instance read as stale. `flock` is
  also atomic against two instances launching together, and the kernel drops it on a force-quit, which is
  the case the unlink covers. Never unlink the lock file: the next instance would lock a fresh inode and
  exclude nobody.
- A refused instance advertises `<socketPath>.unavailable` through `resolvedSocketPath`, so its shells and
  `{AGT_SOCKET}` carry a path nothing serves instead of the resolved default, which would point them at
  the other instance — the user's live terminal, where shared state makes persisted session ids resolve
  too. Do NOT omit the variable instead: `agterm-agent-status.sh` drops `--socket` when it is absent and
  `agtermctl` then resolves that same default, so an unset value routes agent status onto the live app.
  `refused` clears on a later successful acquire, since `start()` re-runs per window scene and the owner
  may have quit. Its `stop()` returns early without unlinking, leaving the owner's socket intact.
- One newline-delimited JSON request and response uses each connection, capped at 1 MiB. Unknown commands
  return structured errors. Mutations may return `result.id`; trees use `result.tree`.
  A decode failure reports the `DecodingError`'s CONTEXT `debugDescription`, not `localizedDescription`, so
  the error NAMES the rejected `cmd`. A caller that cares preflights with `agtermctl version`; no command
  adds a version handshake of its own. A server carrying this code names a LATER unknown command, so it
  diagnoses skew forward — never the newest command against a server that predates it. Read the context,
  never the error:
  `DecodingError.debugDescription` is macOS 26.4+, so at the 14.0 deployment target `String(describing:)`
  degrades to a reflection dump that hides the sentence inside `DecodingError.Context(...)`.
- An unknown ARGUMENT is not symmetric with an unknown command. `ControlArgs` is synthesized `Codable` with
  no `CodingKeys`, so a server that predates a field drops it and runs the command without it, answering ok:
  there is no "unknown field" error and no way to ask. A new field that only narrows or decorates is fine
  that way. One that changes WHERE a mutation lands is not: give it a read-back so a caller can see what the
  server did, rather than leaving the two outcomes indistinguishable. A read-back is any observable read, not
  necessarily a response field: `session.paste --pane` is covered by `session.text --pane`, its documented
  read-back command, as `session.type` and `font.*` are, and `result.pane` is carried by `session.restore`,
  `session.text` and `session.type` for the token reason below, and by `ask.open` for its resolved pane anchor. Since `agtermctl` ships inside the
  bundle, the CLI that sends a field and the app that reads it are the same build, so the exposure is a
  stale RUNNING process across an upgrade, not a mismatched install. Only an app predating `result.pane`
  omits it from a successful `session.restore`; treat absence as UNKNOWN, never as the default pane.
- `agtermctl --json` prints the server's line unchanged: `SocketClient.send` returns a `SocketReply`
  carrying the bytes beside the decoded `ControlResponse`, and `formatResponse` is human-only. Re-encoding
  the decoded struct drops every field the CLI build does not model (#625), so no CLI path prints JSON from
  the model; the pick/ask `--no-block` id object, their result payloads and `events`' per-event lines are
  the deliberate exceptions, each printing its own nested object rather than the response.
- Human output shows IDs only for created session/workspace/window, retains them in JSON, uses
  `result.affected` for session counts and for `zmx.prune`'s killed-daemon count, and reserves
  `result.count` for diagnostics/search.
  A command that reuses `count` for something else must carry its own `result.text`, which the shared
  formatter prefers over every count spelling; `restore.capture` does, or its pane total would print as
  "N diagnostic(s)".
- Targets accept active, case-insensitive UUID, or unique prefix. Batch targets resolve within the first
  target's store, deduplicate, and fail atomically. Preserve the first target in the legacy top-level field
  so old servers degrade to it rather than active.

## Public catalog

The public commands, which no surface states a COUNT of: a total is stated nowhere and pinned by nothing, so
adding one is an edit to this list and the surfaces that document the command itself, never a synchronized
renumbering. Do not reintroduce a count anywhere.

- `workspace.new`, `.rename`, `.delete`, `.select`, `.go`, `.move`, `.focus`, `.filter`, `.collapse`, `.expand`
- `session.new`, `.duplicate`, `.close`, `.select`, `.rename`, `.reveal`, `.move`, `.type`, `.split`,
  `.split.close`, `.swap`, `.lead`, `.reconnect`,

- `zmx.list`, `zmx.screen`, `zmx.prune`, `zmx.kill`, `zmx.reset`, `zmx.tree`, `zmx.attach`, `zmx.present`

`terminfo install` is a CLI-only command with no protocol counterpart, the one exemption from the
protocol/dispatcher contract: it runs `infocmp` and `ssh` locally and never opens the socket, so there is
nothing for the app to dispatch or read back. `TerminfoInstall` in `agtermCore` owns the argv and the
pipeline; the CLI owns the typed option surface, deliberately narrower than ssh's so `-G`, `-N`, `-n` and
`-f` cannot fake a success or hang the install.

`debug.appearance` is a private `Command` case, absent from the list above, used only by `AppearanceFlipUITests`.
It accepts light/dark, sets `NSApp.appearance`, posts `.agtermSystemAppearanceChanged`, echoes the effective
side, and reads `lastAppliedIsDark` when bare. Refuse it outside XCUITest; provide no CLI or skill entry.

## Organization commands

- `workspace.delete` enforces at least one workspace and errors instead of showing the GUI alert.
- `session.close` keeps legacy one-target hard close. Repeated targets are atomic and deduplicated; one
  unique target remains the legacy hard path. Multi-target close follows `closeGraceUndoEnabled`, creates
  one grouped undo/reopen record, and returns actual `affected`; selecting any recent group member restores
  the group and selects that member.
- `session.move` accepts exactly one placement intent:
  - `--to up|down|top|bottom` reorders one session in its workspace.
  - workspace relocates and appends.
  - `--after`/`--before` resolves an anchor across the store, carrying destination workspace.
  Relative placement uses host-free `SidebarDrop.resolveRelative`; batches use tree-order remove-first
  `resolveSessions`. Reject batch `--to`. Count only actual moves. A one-member batch uses singular behavior.
- Sidebar batch Flag computes one uniform value: flag all unless all are already flagged. This is not
  equivalent to repeated toggle; scripts read state then loop on/off. Batch Clear Status is equivalent to
  repeated `session.status idle` and needs no batch command.
- `workspace.move --to up|down|top|bottom` reorders relative to the target. Drag remains the precise
  between-row surface. `active` resolves through `currentWorkspaceID` — a foreground-created workspace
  first, then the selected session's, then `workspaces.last` — so repeated moves may target a different
  workspace; use an ID to keep one target.
- `workspace.go --to next|prev` steps the CURRENT workspace through `visibleWorkspaces`, wrapping, and
  routes through `selectWorkspace`, so it lands on the target's FIRST session and inherits the
  empty-workspace reveal. Relative like `session.go`, so it takes no target; `workspace.move` is the
  neighbouring verb that reorders instead. Returns the workspace id it landed on. Collapse state is NOT a
  term — a folded workspace is stepped into like any other, and issue #435 assumed otherwise. Errors with
  `no other workspace to navigate to` where there is nowhere to step: flagged mode, or one visible
  workspace. Read back through `tree` selection; the GUI twins are `previous_workspace`/`next_workspace`.
- `session.split` drives the addressed session, not active-only `AppActions.toggleSplit`. `--axis
  vertical|horizontal` selects left/right or top/bottom; omitting it preserves an existing split's axis
  and defaults a new split to left/right. Off hides and retains the shell; `session.split.close` and the
  split shell's own exit are what tear it down.
  `split` reports SHOWN, so a hidden split reads false;
  `hasSplit` reports the pane existing at all and is present exactly when `splitRatio`/`splitFocused`
  can be. Callers asking "does this session have a split" read `hasSplit`, and `agtermctl tree` tags the
  hidden case `(split hidden)`.
- `session.split.close` is the teardown verb, its own command rather than a fourth `ControlToggleMode`
  value, which is shared with `session.scratch`/`sidebar` and cannot express close (a hidden split is
  already `off`). Idempotent: a session with no right pane answers ok. The palette's Close Split is the
  GUI twin, a row gated on `hasSplit` with no `BuiltinAction`.
- `session.swap` exchanges the two terminals' physical positions and primary/split roles. Require
  `hasSplit`, not `isSplit`, so hidden splits work; briefly poll a missing surface slot, then return
  `session not realized`. Focus follows the terminal, while axis and ratio stay with the layout. Pane
  metadata, overlays, status ownership, creation identity and wait policy move with their terminal.
  This command is deliberately not idempotent: every successful call reverses the order, and two calls
  restore the prior model and snapshot. It remains valid under zoom and dashboard. Read the new primary
  through `cwd`/`title`/`foreground`/`restoreCommand`/`commandWait`, and the other side through
  `splitCwd`/`splitForeground`/`splitRestoreCommand`/`splitCommandWait`; split title remains unexposed.
- `session.restart` replaces one LIVE pane's shell in place: `killConfirmed` on its daemon, then
  `agtermApp.replacePane` with the command a `session.new --command` pane spawns, so the pane identity, the
  daemon name and the `AGTERM_*` environment stay. The old surface's exit is claimed right after the kill,
  before the first suspension, or the dead client would close the pane during the wait that follows.
  The kill hangs up the old foreground program (next bullet); a restart then waits a second and SIGKILLs
  what is left of that job through `ZmxClient.forceEnd`, since it replaces the program. The new shell
  starts only after that, so it cannot meet a port or lock the old program still holds. Background and
  disowned jobs of the old shell are not ended. A restart that stops AFTER its kill, because the old
  program outlived SIGKILL or the surface could not be rebuilt, runs `handlePaneExit` on the old view and
  says the pane was closed: its exit is claimed by then, so nothing else would ever close a pane left
  without a shell. A session soft-closed during the restart has ITS pending close made final for the
  same reason, since undo would restore that dead pane; `finalizePendingClose(ofSession:)` leaves batch
  mates and every other record undoable. Two refusals come BEFORE the kill: a session no longer in an
  open store and a process table that cannot be read (the old program could not be tracked). A sleeping
  display is not one: `spawnFirst` creates the surface for a view outside any window, which libghostty
  did with the display asleep for 60 seconds (measured), unlike the deck's creation in #416. A new view
  that still fails to create its surface is destroyed and the pane closed, so nothing stays armed to run
  the line at a later wake. An unreadable process
  table counts as "still running" for the wait, never as the program's end.
  `replacePane(spawnFirst:)` gives the new view the old one's frame and creates its surface BEFORE the old
  surface is freed. libghostty routes a queued child-exit by surface address, so a surface created after
  the free can land on that address and take the old child's exit, which closed the pane (measured: the
  event carried the old shell's run time). The same call spawns a pane the deck does not lay out, since
  libghostty creates a surface for a view outside any window. The reply waits for a new leader pid in
  `zmx list` and carries `result.restart` (`paneID`, `oldPid`, `newPid`); they are shell pids, the program
  reads back as `foreground`. With no `command` the host replays the pane's foreground program: the
  argv `tree` reports, read through `ForegroundProcess.observed` from a fresh leader listing, filtered by
  host-free `RestartReplay.resolve` and launched through `attachCommand(replaying:)`. It starts in that
  process's own working directory, never `session.cwd`: the shell-reported cwd can be stale before the
  first prompt. A process that IS the daemon leader and a shell is refused, to prevent replaying the
  hosting wrapper. Everything is decided
  BEFORE the kill, because `attachCommand` answers a rejected argv with a plain shell. The source is never
  `initialCommand` or a restore pin: after `restart --command B` the creation line still says A. The
  receipt's `replayedArgv` is the read-back, present only on a replay; a blank `command` is an error so an
  unset shell variable cannot turn into one. Addressing is `--pane-id` or `--pane left|right`, one required; an unresolved
  token is refused even beside `--pane`, unlike `session.restore`. Non-live, remote and scratch panes are
  refused. It clears the pane's status, ask, HUD and pane overlay through `AppStore.clearPaneOwnedState`
  and leaves `initialCommand` and restore pins alone. Control-native, with no menu item. It leaves the
  accept thread like `zmx.tree`, because the shell it starts calls this socket while the reply is pending.
- Every daemon kill in `ZmxClient` hangs up the shell's FOREGROUND JOB, and nothing else. `zmx kill`
  signals the shell's own process group; a pane's creation command (`session.new --command`, a restart line)
  runs in a group of its own and was measured surviving `session.close` and `zmx.kill` as an orphan, while
  a program typed at the prompt died. Before a kill `foregroundJobs` reads the terminal's foreground group
  from the process table, and a kill zmx CONFIRMED sends that group SIGHUP at once, with no timer, so it
  also lands during app termination and before panes mount. A stale-socket or failed kill sends nothing.
  This is what a closed terminal does: `nohup`, `disown`ed and other background jobs are never signalled,
  and a foreground program that ignores hangups survives a close. Do not widen it to the shell's process
  tree. `ProcessSweeper` is nil by default because a test's fake listing names real pids.
- `session.scratch` is a third, nonpersisted login shell with on/off/toggle. It spawns lazily, survives
  hiding, recreates after exit, and renders as a full translucent cover below overlay. It has no session
  PWD/title link but a weak watermark link. GUI surfaces are Command-J, titlebar, View, and palette.
- `session.focus primary|split|left|right|top|bottom|other` requires an existing split and works shown or
  hidden. The pane is positional; read `splitFocused`.
- `session.resize` accepts exactly one absolute ratio or one relative
  `--grow-left|right|primary|split|top|bottom` delta, defaulting an unset ratio to 0.5. Require a split,
  clamp through store limits, persist, then post the object-scoped live-divider notification. Hidden split
  stores for next show. Return clamped ratio as `%.3f`; read `splitRatio`.
  The fraction is of the pane area BELOW the titlebar band, not the full split height, so an even ratio
  renders even in every toolbar mode. Only a drag captures the live divider; `session.resize`, the
  double-click reset and the first-layout seed set the value directly. A shown split therefore always
  reports a ratio, so absence means no split or one never shown, never "at the default".
- `session.go --to next|prev|first|last|next-attention|prev-attention` operates on current selection in
  the placement store, wraps within filtered scope, and returns selected ID. It has no target.
- `notify` requires body, defaults title and session, skips OSC focus suppression, increments unseen, and
  uses click identity. When banners are disabled, return `ControlNotify.bannersOffNote` (#286); delivered
  requests omit text. Read through `unseen`.

## Session creation and duplication

- `session.new` chooses one mutually exclusive destination:
  - workspace ID/prefix/active;
  - exact-trimmed workspace name, optionally create-or-reuse;
  - `--after`/`--before` anchor, which supplies workspace and insertion index.
  Reject both anchors, placement plus workspace, name plus ID, create without name, and missing name without
  create. Insert indices are clamped.
- `--command` becomes raw libghostty `config.command`, not shell input. Ghostty quote-splits into argv and
  executes directly, so operators, expansion, redirection, and globs require an explicit `sh -c` or
  `zsh -lc`. GUI launch PATH lacks `/opt/homebrew/bin`; missing binaries exit 127, so use absolute paths
  or a login shell.
- `initialCommand` persists and reruns only when restored-command support is enabled; fresh sessions always
  run it. Captured foreground takes precedence. Promoting a split survivor clears the exited pane's initial
  command.
- `--no-select` neither changes selection/recency/focus nor reveals a newly created workspace into an
  applied focus set. Foreground creates add their new workspace to the set instead of disabling filtering.
  Do not overload the opposite-polarity `ControlArgs.select`.
- `session.duplicate` atomically creates a plain login shell after the source in the same workspace from
  `focusedCwd`. Copy no name, command, pane, status, flag, font, or background state. The new tree node is
  the read-back. Source `tree.cwd` remains primary, so it can differ from the focused cwd copied.

## Surface input, output, and search

- `session.type --pane` accepts `primary|left|top`, `split|right|bottom`, or `scratch`; omission defaults
  to primary for compatibility, not focused/on-screen. Read-back and the stable invalid-value error use
  canonical `left|right|scratch` names. The spelling is parsed ONCE, in the dispatcher, and the host takes
  a `StatusPane`: `session.type`, `session.text` and `font.*` go through `parseSurfacePane`, so the aliases
  resolve for a raw socket client too, and they keep their own `invalid pane: <value>` rejection while
  `session.status`/`.restore` keep the pinned one. Never match a pane spelling in the app target.
  Hidden live scratch is addressable; missing panes error. Main alone bounded-polls (12 × 30ms) a newly
  unrealized session, with or without `select`, so `session.new --no-select` plus an immediate type does
  not race the mount+layout gap (#349). The probe precedes every sleep, so a realized session pays nothing
  and `select` moves selection only when the surface was not ready. `right`/`scratch` still fail fast.
- A restored pane still waiting on its launch spawn permit (a replaying launch paces spawns) is expedited
  by every command that must act on a live surface: `session.type` (left before its poll, right before
  the inject), `session.search`, `session.paste`, `session.selectall` and `font.inc/dec/reset`. Reads never
  do: `session.text`, `session.copy` and `surface.cursor` answer `session not realized` or
  `surface not realized` and leave the pane queued. No command sets that state, so there is no read-back
  beyond `realized` and the tree's `(not realized)` tag, and both describe the MAIN pane only: a queued
  right pane shows nothing, so an empty tree is no proof the queue drained. The pacer's `onDrain` debug
  log is the drain signal.
- `injectText` resolves only `surface`/`splitSurface`/`scratchSurface`, so like `session.text` every `--pane`
  addresses the pane UNDER a covering overlay: the keystrokes run in the hidden shell, unseen until it closes,
  while the call answers ok. This is the intended behavior, not a gap — the panes are the session's durable
  input surfaces and stay drivable whatever is drawn over them, so a cover never has to be torn down to keep
  automation running. Reads are the asymmetric half by design: `overlay.copy`/`overlay.text` exist because an
  overlay's output is otherwise unobservable, while its program is the caller's own and needs no second way in.
  Do not add a write twin, and do not make a covered `session.type` fail — a caller would lose the pane it
  still legitimately addresses.
- `session.type` ok means the keystrokes were queued to the pty, not that the shell read or ran them (#350).
  Nothing is lost in between: libghostty's write mailbox blocks instead of dropping, messages queued before
  the io thread starts are drained once the subprocess is up, and no code path flushes pending tty input.
  A NUL never reaches that path: `ghostty_input_key_s.text` is NUL-terminated and libghostty slices at the
  first zero, so `session.type`/`quick.type` reject text carrying one with `text must not contain a NUL
  byte` rather than typing the run up to it, sending its Return, and answering ok (#455).
  A caller needing execution polls `session.text`, which is what the e2e marker idiom does.
  `ghostty_surface_key`'s bool reports consumption, not delivery, so checking it would add no readiness.
- `inject` emits Ghostty key events and Return keycode 36 for newline/CR/CRLF. Never replace it with
  `ghostty_surface_text`, whose bracketed paste suppresses Return and can expose `\e[200~`/`\e[201~`
  markers under rapid use.
- The final Return of a payload that ends in a line ending and has text before it is held back
  `KeystrokeSegments.submitGap` (10 ms), on both routes: `inject`, which `session.type` and
  `quick.type` share, blocks the main thread for it, and
  `coveredType` sends the text and the Return as two acknowledged `zmx type` calls (#679).
  Claude Code reads a Return arriving in the same burst as a long text run as pasted content and does
  not submit.
  The gap is blocking, never scheduled: a deferred Return can be overtaken by another injection or a keystroke.
  It is one fixed gap per call, so do not scale it by length or add one per line.
  A receiver classifying one long line or a multi-line payload as a paste is the caller's to work around
  by sending shorter pieces; pacing inside agterm would block the main thread per piece on both routes.
  Limits: Returns inside a multi-line payload stay back to back and still read as paste in such a program;
  a writer on another Mac can land between the two daemon calls;
  a failed second daemon call answers an error with the text already typed and is never retried,
  since the daemon queues before it answers and a timeout does not prove the Return was dropped.
- `session.copy` returns the addressed main selection without touching clipboard; empty is `no selection`,
  and an unrealized pane is `session not realized` — `readSelection` cannot tell the two apart, and copy is
  select-all's read-back, so both name that state the same way. It stays on the PANE while an overlay covers
  it, so a selection made inside one is `session.overlay.copy`'s, not this command's.
  `session.paste` and `.selectall` run Ghostty bindings through one arm. `session.paste` takes `--pane`
  so its `session.text` read-back can name the same pane; the dispatcher parses it into `StatusPane`
  (`session.status`'s `parsePane`, so the role and position aliases resolve and a raw client gets the same
  pinned rejection) and the arm takes the parsed value, never a spelling. `.selectall` stays on main, its
  `session.copy` read-back having no pane either. Omitted, and for select-all always, the pane is
  `Session.addressableSurface = surface ?? splitSurface`, never focus-aware `activeSurface`, so select-all
  and copy share one pane. Read paste through text and select-all through copy.
- Keep standard SwiftUI Edit routing. `GhosttySurfaceView` implements Copy/Paste/Select All and validation;
  focused text fields retain their behavior, terminal Cut stays absent. Do not replace the combined
  pasteboard command group. Remove the separate Undo/Redo group because Command-Z belongs to Reopen Closed
  Item; assert menu-item absence.
- Paste validation must call the same URL/string branches as paste. Type-only probes disagree for Finder
  URLs and declared-without-data pasteboards. Short-circuit on the first usable URL and share `urlText`;
  validation must not materialize thousands of files. This has manual named-pasteboard coverage because
  sandboxed XCUITest exposed no app-side types during an 8-second Finder-URL poll. Poll general pasteboard
  after external writes.
- Fixed Edit shortcuts use AppKit-produced characters. Retain Ghostty
  `super+key_c/v/a` keycode fallbacks for non-Latin layouts and disabled menu items; there is no AppKit
  Latin fallback. Paste requests are not OSC 52 reads and must not prompt.
- `session.text` defaults to `onScreenSurface`: covering scratch, then focused pane. Explicit left/right/
  scratch addresses that pane, including hidden scratch. Default reads viewport; `--all` includes
  scrollback; `--lines N` returns last content lines after trimming blank grid rows. All and lines are
  exclusive; N must be positive and dispatcher-validated. Blank returns empty success; API failure errors.
  An UNREALIZED pane answers `session not realized`, not `failed to read surface buffer`, whether its slot
  is empty or holds a view whose libghostty surface never came up — one state to a caller, and the reading
  never happened. `failed to read surface buffer` is left to a real read failure on a realized surface.
  `quick.text` keeps its own vocabulary and still reports that string for an unrealized quick surface.
  Output is plain text because pinned Ghostty exposes no styled-cell read.
  `--pane-id` accepts a stable surface token and resolves it against live slots before `--pane`.
  This is the read path for a long-running watcher whose baked `AGTERM_PANE` spawn role may be stale
  after promotion or swap.
  `onScreenSurface` is pane-vs-scratch only, so every `--pane` and the default alike read the surface
  UNDER an overlay; the covering program is `session.overlay.text`.
- `session.search` selects and realizes the target, then searches its focused surface. Text opens/updates;
  to next/prev navigates; close ends; no arguments opens empty UI. Poll async SEARCH_TOTAL and return count
  plus `searchDisplayText`. Search fields are ephemeral and shared with the GUI.
- `quick.type`/`quick.text` mirror session input/read for the frontmost single quick surface, with no
  window/target/pane. Poll up to 12 times at 30ms after quick show; distinguish not open, not realized,
  read failure, and no open window. Hidden previously shown quick remains addressable (#170).
  Text is type's read-back.

## Overlay, zoom, dashboard, pick, and ask

- Overlay open runs one shell-wrapped program in a nonpersisted per-session surface. Size nil is full;
  1...100 is floating; values outside that range are refused. Optional color uses shared validated
  `#rrggbb` surface config and window opacity.
  Background target runs without selection; `--follow` selects. `--wait` retains Ghostty's exit prompt.
- `--pane left|right` on open/close/result scopes the overlay to ONE split pane, leaving the sibling live.
  Slots are independent and always full-pane: reject `--pane` with `--size-percent` and on `overlay.resize`.
  Refuse a pane the deck does not lay out (`pane not visible`) and an occupied slot
  (`pane overlay already open`). Omitting `--pane` keeps the session-wide overlay byte-for-byte.
  Promotion moves the right pane's overlay into the left slot without rebuilding its surface, so that
  surface's callbacks resolve their pane through `Session.paneOverlayRole(of:)`, never a captured one.
  Read back `paneOverlays`, ordered left-then-right.
- Both full and floating use one always-present `overlayPanel` in `sessionDetail`'s overlay preference
  layer. Gate content inside its `GeometryReader`; never change the `sessionDetail`/HSplitView shape or
  pane modifiers on overlay state.
  Full is translucent/chromeless and hides panes; floating is opaque/framed over visible panes with an
  internal click catcher. Value-only resizing must not reparent the Metal surface.
- Handle `GHOSTTY_ACTION_SHOW_CHILD_EXITED`. Return true for immediate close, false for wait; process-exit
  handling must be idempotent. Use bounded first-responder retries and refocus underlying surface on close.
- Exit status uses env-carried command/temp path in fixed
  `sh -c '( eval "$AGTERM_OVL_CMD" ); echo $? > "$AGTERM_OVL_CODE"'`, without output redirection.
  Read/delete during surface teardown before callbacks are cleared. `overlay.result` returns exit code,
  still-running, or no-result. CLI `--block` polls returned session ID, rejects `--wait`, prints no process
  output, and exits with captured status.
- `overlay.resize` requires an open overlay and exactly one valid percent or `--full`; mutate the same
  surface host. Read `overlaySizePercent`, gated by overlay-active because nil means either full or absent.
- `overlay.copy`/`overlay.text` read the COVERING surface, which `session.copy`/`session.text` cannot reach
  (#434) — those address the pane the overlay hides, so a selection made in the overlay reads as
  `no selection` and `--pane right` returns the shell underneath. Both take the overlay family's own
  `--pane`, never the shared `left|right|scratch` one: widening that would let `session.status`/`.restore`
  reach a `StatusPane` that has no overlay case, over persisted state. `ControlServer.overlayReadSurface`
  resolves both, so an empty slot (`no overlay`) and a filled one whose surface has not come up
  (`overlay not realized`, naming the cover rather than borrowing `session not realized`) cannot mean
  different things on one command than the other. A HUD is refused ahead of both with
  `OverlayHudError.noRead`: it paints the app's own message, and `overlayActive` alone cannot tell it from
  a caller's program. `overlay.text` validates `--all`/`--lines` through the same `parseBufferExtent` as
  `session.text`, before the pane, so identical flags produce the identical first error. These are reads,
  so they add no read-back field.
- `session.hud.*` puts a passive message panel in the SESSION-WIDE overlay slot rather than adding a cover,
  so the Command-W ladder, `coverHidesActiveSession`, `searchTarget`, and session-close teardown are
  unchanged. It is control-native: no menu item, chord, or palette entry, a deliberate exemption from
  [[menu-actions]]'s shared-action-seam rule because there is nothing here for a human to invoke by hand.
- Passivity is four deck exemptions plus two NSView-level gates, each reading an occupant predicate and
  never the raw slot: `gates.overlaid`, the floating click catcher, `backdropWashActive`, the scratch's focus
  gate, `TerminalView.viewOnly` on the panel, and the cover-only key for the overlay-close refocus. The HTML
  bullet below says which read `coverOverlayActive` and which `programOverlayActive`. `viewOnly` owns the
  NSView layer, where `mouseDown` makes a surface first responder; the panel's ancestor
  `.allowsHitTesting(false)` currently blocks the click before that, so the two are belt and braces and
  neither is the place to economise.
  Keying the refocus on the raw slot instead yanks focus out of a search field or a rename on every
  close. Never spell it inline; two spellings will disagree. `OverlayPanelStyle` resolves
  every per-occupant parameter, so the modifier chain stays constant and only values flip. `overlayPanel`'s
  `.id` carries `Session.overlaySlotGeneration`, or a replacement keeping `overlayActive` true never re-runs
  `makeNSView` and `updateNSView` hits a torn-down view.
- The occupant predicates govern focus routing too: `Session.topmostSurface`, `focusTarget(wantSplit:)`,
  `onScreenSurface`, `AppActions.searchTarget`'s scratch rung, and the scratch factory's `suppressAutoFocus`.
  A raw `overlayActive` read at any of them hands first responder or a buffer read to the HUD painter.
- An HTML page (`Session.htmlOverlay`, `PaneOverlay.html`) is a third occupant: it covers and owns input
  like a program but has no terminal surface, zoom target or exit status. `programOverlayActive` excludes
  it; `coverOverlayActive` (program or page) is the input-exclusion question. Cover sites: `gates.overlaid`,
  the click catcher, `backdropWashActive`, the scratch focus gate, the overlay-close refocus key,
  `suppressAutoFocus`, `searchTarget`'s scratch rung, `DeckPaneGates.coverActive`, the tree `overlay` field,
  the remote overlay's local-hold check, and zoom's `uncovered`/`paneVisible`. Program-only sites:
  `TerminalView.viewOnly`, zoom's `.overlay` and pane-overlay arms, and `overlay.result`'s running check.
  Under a page `topmostSurface` and `focusTarget` return nil, never the hidden pane, and zoom's
  `resolveTarget` returns nil. The font commands follow the page too: ⌘+/⌘−/⌘0 route to it when
  `AppActions.htmlPageOwnsKeys` says so, and `font.*` when `Session.htmlHidesTerminal` does; both step the one
  app-wide `HtmlZoom` factor, read back as `htmlOverlays[].zoom`, never the terminal the page hides.
  `dropUnrealizedPaneOverlays` never drops a page, which has no surface to
  realize. Every path that empties a slot holding a page fires `HtmlOverlayReleases` once: `closeOverlay`,
  `closePaneOverlay`, `teardownPaneOverlay`, and `Session.teardownOverlaySlot` at session, workspace,
  pending-close and window teardown. The app's `HtmlOverlayRegistry` keys web views by the page's id, which
  travels inside the slot value, so swaps, promotion and the soft-close window move the page intact.
- A page's source is `HtmlSource`: a file with its grant, or a URL (`--url`, absolute http/https, no
  `--cwd`). The dispatcher parses it once and the host gets `options.page`; the tree reports `file` or
  `url`. A URL page is pinned to its ORIGINAL origin (`HtmlOrigin`, default ports equal): same-origin main
  frame loads clicked or not, which is what lets dev-server redirects and client routing work, any
  http(s) subframe loads, and a redirect elsewhere during an unclicked load is refused. A clicked link's
  redirect reaches the policy as `.linkActivated` (WebKit reuses the triggering action), so it is handled
  like the click and the retained page stays `loaded`. `HtmlOverlayPage.loadPending` makes every
  load in flight (explicit, or started by the page) end `loaded` or `failed`: a policy cancel of its main
  frame reports `navigation blocked: URL` and the `WebKitErrorDomain` 102 that follows is ignored. An
  unreported 102, WebKit dropping a response it cannot show, restores `loaded` over a document the web
  content process still shows, and fails a load that never committed. A failed page shows its error in the panel.
- A page gets its own `WKWebsiteDataStore.nonPersistent()`, set before the web view exists, so browser
  storage lives exactly as long as the overlay and is shared with no other. `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` in
  Info.plist lets plain http reach local addresses (not only loopback, and for file pages too); public
  http stays subject to ATS.
- A URL page opened with `--persistent` (`HtmlOverlay.persistent`, read back as `persistent`) uses ONE saved
  store shared by every such page, `WKWebsiteDataStore(forIdentifier:)`. File pages and a program refuse the
  flag. `BrowserProfile` keeps the store's UUID in `<stateDir>/browser-profile`, created on first use:
  WebKit files the data under `~/Library/WebKit/<bundle id>/WebsiteDataStore/<UUID>`, outside the state
  directory, so the id file is what keeps two state directories apart, and a fixed id would hand every
  instance one jar. Only a MISSING file creates an id. An unreadable or malformed one is an error and is left
  alone, because a new id would orphan the store holding every login; the open is then refused and never
  falls back to an in-memory store.
- `HtmlOverlayRegistry` owns the saved store. The open adapter asks `persistentStoreFailure()` before it
  accepts a persistent page and builds the page before replying, so the page counts as open from the moment
  the open answers ok; every other page is still built when a view first asks for it.
- `browser.clear` removes all website data from the saved store and keeps its id. App-global: a target or
  `--window` is refused. It answers ok without creating anything when no profile exists, and replies only
  after WebKit reports the removal done. It is refused with `N persistent page(s) still open` while any
  page built on the store is registered, soft-closed ones included, since an open page holds its login in
  memory and writes it back. While a removal runs, a persistent open that reaches the app is refused with
  `browser storage is being cleared`, as is a second clear: a page's bridge request, a view building its
  page, or a socket request when the clear came from a page. A socket request sent during a SOCKET-issued
  clear is not refused. The accept loop serves one connection at a time, so it waits and runs once the
  clear is done, on the emptied store. Deliberately no tree read-back, no event and no menu item: the store
  has no per-window state, and the reply is the result. Not solved here: an external login (OAuth, SSO, a
  popup) leaves the pinned origin, cookies ignore ports so `localhost` apps share them, a cookie with no
  expiry is not promised to outlive the app, and clearing does not sign anyone out on the server.
- `--cwd DIR` is WebKit's read grant. Without it the page is loaded from its TEXT with no base URL:
  WebKit reads a single-file `allowingReadAccessTo` as the file's whole folder, measured in
  `HtmlOverlayRegistryTests`, so the file-alone default needs no file URL at all, and a `--cwd` naming the
  file itself is refused, as are `/` and the home directory.
- A FILE page's default style is the terminal theme (`HtmlOverlayTheme`): a zero-specificity `:where(html)`
  rule for scheme and text color, injected at document start. Its background is NOT in CSS: the file web view
  draws no canvas (`drawsBackground`, the one private key) and the panel paints the theme or
  `--background-color` behind it, so an authored `html` or `body` background still fills the canvas.
- Every page's rule, a URL page's included, defines `--agterm-background`, `--agterm-foreground` and
  `--agterm-color-0..15` (`GhosttyApp.terminalPalette`, slots kept, an invalid entry omitted). A URL page gets
  only those variables and keeps the browser's opaque canvas, because a web app styled against a white canvas
  turns unreadable over the theme backing. Inject the rule at document start in a dedicated content world.
  Do not evaluate theme scripts in a live document: page callbacks can inherit evaluation's user gesture.
  Reload file pages only when their computed theme changes; URL pages receive new variables on their next
  load. The appearance notification also fires for unrelated settings.
- A page's own JavaScript is off unless opened with `--js` (`HtmlOverlay.javascript`, read back as
  `javascript`): `allowsContentJavaScript` is set on the configuration before the web view exists, and
  nothing enables it later. User scripts and native `evaluateJavaScript` still run, so the theme survives,
  and a test cannot use evaluation to show page script ran; tests that need page script open with it on.
- A synthetic `a.click()` reaches the policy exactly like a real click (`.linkActivated`, button 0, no
  flags), so every hand-off the page starts goes through `HtmlBrowser.confirm`, a nonblocking sheet with
  Cancel as default; nothing in control dispatch waits on it. One pending prompt per page, a decline silences the
  page until a native key or mouse event reaches its view, and closing, hiding or detaching the view ends
  the prompt without opening. Open in Browser (toolbar or `navigate browser`) is an explicit request and
  skips the prompt; it opens with the default browser app, never the file type's app, which could run it.
- The panel has an app-drawn identity strip (`HtmlOverlay.identity`: the file shown or the origin)
  that the page cannot cover or retitle, with the close button; `--navigation` adds the buttons. The page
  title follows it as a separate dimmed view that yields width first, never replacing the identity; agents
  reading it from `tree` must treat it as untrusted. `--chromeless` (`HtmlOverlay.chromeless`) drops the strip,
  file pages only: a URL page's strip is the only statement of whose content it is. It is refused with
  `--navigation`, whose buttons live in the strip, and closes through the Command-W ladder, which
  `ControlHtmlOverlayUITests` pins against a `--js` page that cancels every keydown.
  Page views refuse drags and pastes
  carrying files; WKWebView's paste commands exist only at runtime, so they are overridden by selector.
- Reload is `overlay.reload --current` (bare `overlay.reload` loads the original source).
  Back/forward/browser/finder share `overlay.navigate` with the toolbar, even without `--navigation`.
  Finder reveals the current file via `pageURL`; browser opens the original file or current HTTP(S) URL.
  Finder refuses URL sources without side effects.
  Copy Link is a URL-page toolbar action only: it copies `browserURL` to the pasteboard.
  Scripts read the current address from `tree`'s `htmlOverlays[].page`.
  `HtmlSharing` isolates Finder and clipboard effects for hosted tests.
  A page never takes the remote program-job path:
  `open --html` is refused while a presenter owns the session, and one already open stays local.
- A FILE page drives the control API from its own content; `site/docs.html#page-bridge` owns the user
  contract. Pages are self-authored and trusted like a program overlay, which already inherits
  `AGTERM_SOCKET`, so there are no permission tiers; a URL page gets none of it. Two surfaces, one path:
  `HtmlOverlayBridge.adapterScript` handles `data-agterm` tags in its own content world, so it runs with
  page JS off, and `--js` adds the page-world `agterm.request`. Both reach `HtmlOverlayPage.handleBridgeRequest`,
  which refuses frames, resolves the page where it sits NOW through `htmlOverlaySlot`, builds the request
  with `HtmlBridge` and dispatches through `HtmlOverlayRegistry.dispatch`, the closure `ControlServer` sets
  to its own `dispatch` so the window cache refreshes and unmigrated commands still reach the app switch.
  Each admitted request calls its reply closure exactly once; a page its command closed never sees it.
- `HtmlBridge` speaks the wire protocol only (`{cmd, target, args}`, dotted names, typed fields) and
  fills only what a page left out: its session for session-targeted commands (the `session.` names bar
  `new`, `go` and `overlay.job.run`, plus `notify`, the `font.*` trio, `keymap.run` and a non-GUI
  `ask.open`), its pane
  for its own overlay commands, its window as `target` for the window-object commands and as `args.window`
  otherwise. An explicit target, `active`, window or batch resolves as over the socket; `zmx.attach` and
  `dashboard` keep their ids and still land in the page's window, and `hooks.*`, which refuse any window,
  and `browser.clear` get none. `sidebar` and `sidebar.mode` read no window, so a page drives the frontmost one.
  `zmx.present`, `session.overlay.job.run` and `zmx.reset` are refused: a stream hand-off and post-reply work do not fit one request and reply.
- The theme, adapter and helper scripts install as ONE set: removing user scripts removes them all, so a
  separate install would lose the adapter at the next theme change. Release unregisters the handlers;
  reload keeps them.
- `HtmlPageOutcomes` keys every page's selector outcome by page id, outside the slot, so a caller blocked
  on a page reads it after the page and its session are gone. A successful open registers `pending`;
  `session.overlay.submit` records `submitted` before closing; `HtmlOverlayReleases.release` records
  `dismissed` for a page still pending, before `onRelease`, which the registry keeps sole ownership of.
  A soft close stays pending through the grace period. The open reply carries `pageID` and tree
  `htmlOverlays` nodes carry `id`; `session.overlay.result --page` reads the outcome, and the CLI's
  `--html --block` polls it with pick's exit codes.
- One slot, asymmetric replacement: a second `hud.open` replaces the first, `overlay.open` closes a HUD and
  proceeds, and a HUD over a RUNNING program is refused `overlay already open`. `overlay.close`, Command-W,
  and session close tear a HUD down. `overlay.result` refuses with `OverlayHudError.noResult` because
  `overlayActive` alone would answer the misleading "overlay still running", and `overlay.resize` takes a
  percent but refuses `--full` (`OverlayHudError.fullResize`), which would cover the session it describes.
- `--hide-after SECONDS` takes the panel down by itself; omitted or 0 leaves it up, which is what every HUD
  did before. `0...HudSpec.maxHideAfter` (86400 seconds), REJECTED rather than clamped, by one predicate
  (`HudSpec.isValidHideAfter`) the CLI and the dispatcher share — the ceiling is the scheduler's own, since
  `seconds * 1_000_000_000` into a `UInt64` traps on a large enough Double, and `armHudAutoHide` clamps to it
  as well so a raw-socket caller cannot reach that conversion past a validation that drifted. Each SUCCESSFUL open or update restarts the
  full interval and an omitted value cancels it, which is `hud.update`'s replace-whole-spec rule rather than
  an exception to it; a rejected write never touches timer state, so the panel on screen keeps the deadline
  that came with it. The clock is elapsed lifetime, not viewing time: it runs while the session is
  unselected, its pane hidden or its window minimized, and expiry closes the panel without selecting
  anything. `ControlServer.armHudAutoHide` owns it, carrying a per-session REVISION because `updateHud`
  must not bump `overlaySlotGeneration` (that identity re-creates the surface), so the revision is what makes
  a superseded callback inert. Cancellation hangs off `Session.onHudDiscarded`, which `discardHudBody` calls,
  so every teardown routing through it — `closeOverlay`, session and workspace teardown, pending-close
  finalization, window teardown — takes the timer with the panel. A SOFT close is the one place that closes a
  panel early: `AppStore.closeTimedHud` takes down a TIMED HUD before its session leaves the tree, since an
  expiry could not resolve it there and undo would restore a panel whose time was up; a panel with no
  auto-hide keeps the undo behaviour it always had. `tree`'s `hud.hideAfter` reads back the CONFIGURED
  seconds, 0 for persistent, never a countdown.
- `hud.open` and `hud.update` accept `--pane` plus `--pane-id` with `session.restore`'s resolution rule: a
  live stable token wins over the role fallback, while an unknown token without a fallback errors. The
  resolved pane identity is stored, so swap and promotion move the HUD with its shell. A hidden target keeps
  the HUD alive but unmounted; destroying the target closes it. Open refuses a pane the deck does not render.
  Omission keeps the existing session-detail coordinate space. This is still one last-writer-wins HUD.
  `ControlActions` retains the original session-wide methods and defaults the placement-carrying overloads
  to them, so an `agterm-linux` conformer owes no source change until it adopts pane placement.
- Zoom narrows on the same predicate: `isActive`'s shared `uncovered` and its `.scratch`/`.overlay` arms,
  `isAvailable`'s `.overlay` arm, `isVisible`, and `paneVisible`. Widen `uncovered` and narrow the `.overlay`
  arm together or no case is active and the documented-unreachable `?? .primary` fallback runs. The explicit
  `surface:<id>:overlay` address is REFUSED for a HUD, and no overlay surface node is listed beside it.
- A HUD sizes each axis separately, through `HudLayout.panelSize` into one `HudPanelSize` that travels
  store-to-deck: width from the box's columns, height from its rows. One percent across both made every
  panel as tall as it was wide, which is a square box around two lines of text, so `OverlayPanelStyle`
  carries `widthFraction`/`heightFraction` and only a PROGRAM overlay sets them equal. A pane-scoped HUD
  takes both dimensions, its anchor offsets, and the edge margin from the deck pane host's live bounds.
  The pane hosts publish those bounds in the session detail coordinate space. Never derive them from
  `splitRatio` or the terminal surface frame: the ratio is observation-ignored and the surface moves on zoom.
- `--size-percent` reaches the WIDTH alone, on open and on `overlay.resize` — the text wraps at
  `HudLayout.maxColumns`, not at the panel, so a resize changes no rows — and the height takes no caller
  override at all. Every HUD WIDTH passes `HudLayout.clampSizePercent` (10...80), the caller's included, so
  `--full`'s refusal and the never-cover invariant cannot disagree. The height is capped at the same 80 but
  takes NO minimum floor: the box already carries `verticalPadding`, and flooring it is the square again.
  The 80 cap is also what makes an edge anchor always fit its margin on EITHER axis, each axis' own extent
  being what decides how far the panel travels there; the centering fallback in `OverlayPanelStyle`'s two
  offsets is defensive only.
- `HudPosition` is the nine anchors of a 3x3 grid, spelled exactly as `BackgroundWatermark.Position` so
  `--position` means one thing across `session.background` and `session.hud`. The bare `top`/`bottom` it
  shipped with stay ACCEPTED as aliases for the middle column, and `HudPosition.parse` is the one entry
  point that resolves them — dispatcher, CLI validation and `init(from:)` all take it, so no path accepts a
  name another rejects. They NORMALIZE: the read-back reports the canonical anchor, which is what makes them
  aliases rather than a second vocabulary. Rejections and CLI help list `acceptedNamesList`, never the
  canonical set alone, for the same reason `HudSpinner` lists `none`. `verticalBand`/`horizontalBand` split
  an anchor into its row and column so `OverlayPanelStyle` runs one offset over each axis.
- An unmeasured pane splits the fallback: width takes `maxSizePercent` (nothing is known to fit), height
  takes `minSizePercent` (80% of a pane is a cover, not a message). `OverlayPanelStyle` falls back the same
  way for a HUD whose height has not been measured yet.
- `HudSpinner` owns the spinner: one case per style, each carrying its own FRAMES and tick interval, and
  both ride the body header so the helper holds no table and a case is one edit. Frames must be single
  scalars that render one column and contain no space — the header is word-split, and `spinnerWidth`
  reserves exactly two cells. `dot`'s blank frame is U+00A0, not a space, for that reason.
  The CLI keeps `--spinner` as the on switch for `HudSpinner.defaultStyle` and adds `--spinner-style`,
  which implies it; both resolve client-side, so `ControlArgs.spinner` always carries a style name or
  nothing and the dispatcher validates one thing. `noneName` is ACCEPTED by both, not just the socket —
  refusing it in the CLI would fail a value `tree` had just handed the caller — and beats a bare
  `--spinner` beside it. Rejection messages list it through `acceptedNamesList`, never the styles alone.
- The panel's two colors are owned by different layers, which is why only one is updatable:
  `backgroundColor` is a per-surface config the factory reads ONCE at creation, `textColor` rides the body
  file's header as SGR PARAMETERS the helper re-reads every tick. So `hud.update` recolors text in place and
  cannot touch the backing, and the CLI's `update` takes `--text-color` but no `--background-color`.
  `HudLayout.foregroundSGR` owns the encoding, host-free, and resolves a malformed hex to the
  `noTextColor` sentinel rather than a partial run; the helper converts nothing and wraps only digits and
  semicolons, so a malformed header cannot emit an arbitrary escape into the pane.
- Read back `ControlSessionNode.hud` with BOTH shares, `sizePercent` and `heightPercent`, `overlay` false
  and `overlaySizePercent` omitted beside it, plus `textColor` (omitted when the panel keeps the terminal
  foreground, and tracking the LATEST update unlike `backgroundColor`);
  `position` and `spinner` always report the effective value, defaults included — `spinner` names the STYLE
  and spells a static panel `HudSpinner.noneName`, which the dispatcher accepts back as "no spinner" so a
  caller can round-trip what `tree` gave it. `pane` names the targeted identity's current role and is omitted
  for session-wide placement. HUD state is poll-only.
  `openOverlay`/`closeOverlay` emit no `scheduleTreeChanged()` and neither does a HUD, so document no event.
- The panel is a pty running bundled `Resources/hud/hud.sh`, spawned `autoFocus: false` with
  `AGTERM_HUD_FILE` as its only HUD-SPECIFIC variable (the surface still inherits the session environment
  and the overlay wrapper's `AGTERM_OVL_*` pair) and capturing no exit code. Grid, spinner (flag, interval
  and frames), text color and the APP'S PID
  ride the body file's HEADER line and are re-read every tick, so `hud.update` repaints in place with no
  respawn; write that file atomically. The frames are LAST because they alone are variable-length and the
  helper shifts the fixed fields off to reach them, so a new fixed field goes before them and owes the
  helper a matching shift count. It is per SESSION, so an update rewrites the path the running helper
  already opened. `Session.discardHudBody` is the only deleter and every store teardown runs it — close,
  ⌘W, session/workspace/window teardown — so a HUD closed before its surface realized cannot strand the
  message text in `/tmp`. An update carries the OPEN's background color forward, the factory reading it once
  at creation, so `hud.backgroundColor` never names a color the panel will not paint.
- The header's grid is `HudLayout.paintGrid` — the PANEL's own cells (`panelGrid`: the effective percent of
  the pane, less `window-padding-*`, over the measured cell), NOT `HudLayout.box`, which only decides the
  size. Both now measure the same message, so the two usually agree, but the panel is whole CELLS of a
  rounded percent and the box is not — centering on the box can still strand the message by a column or a
  row, and a `--size-percent` width detaches them outright. `box` remains the fallback when nothing is
  measured. Every path that changes the panel's size — open, update, `overlay.resize` — must rewrite the
  header through `ControlServer.writeHudBody`, which reads the size the STORE resolved. The deck's own size
  change is the fourth: it calls `Session.onHudGeometryChange`, which `ControlServer.watchHudGeometry`
  installs at open and coalesces into one rewrite per main-actor turn.
- `--markdown` (`HudSpec.markdown`) renders standard markdown through Foundation's `.full` parser in
  `HudMarkdown`, with no dialect of its own: a single LF inside a paragraph is a soft break, lists always
  render tight because the parser does not say which a list was, and trailing all-empty table rows and an
  all-empty header are lost because the parser emits nothing for them. The dispatcher allows LF and TAB in a
  markdown message only, through its own check, leaving the shared `containsControlCharacters` untouched,
  and caps it at `HudSpec.maxMarkdownLength`; the renderer replaces control characters the parser decoded
  from entities. The dispatcher also refuses a markdown message that renders nothing visible
  (`HudMarkdown.rendersVisibleText`).
  A table renders framed in box-drawing borders with a header rule only when the header has cells, and a
  thematic break spans the widest other row. Text wraps at `maxColumns`, table rows stay intact, and all rows are clipped to the grid on
  both axes in `renderedBody`, so the painter never measures them: the header's seventh field, `blockwidth`, is 0 for plain mode and the
  painted width of the finished rows otherwise, and the helper prints those rows verbatim at one shared
  offset. The painter draws the spinner glyph on the first row; the renderer indents the others by the gutter.
- `--font-size` (`HudSpec.fontSize`, `HudSpec.fontSizeRange`) is open-only, like `--background-color`, because
  the surface reads it at creation; update rejects it. `Session.hudFontSize` records the EFFECTIVE creation
  size, resolved before measuring and stored by `AppStore.openHud` after a replaced HUD's teardown clears it,
  and every later measurement (update, `overlay.resize`, geometry refresh) uses it, so a session zoom never
  changes the cell a HUD is measured with. `hud.fontSize` reads back the request, omitted when inherited.
- The helper forces `LC_CTYPE=UTF-8` on itself: `${#line}` counts BYTES otherwise, and a Dock-launched app
  inherits launchd's locale-less environment. Under it `${#line}` counts CODE POINTS, so the app measures in
  `HudLayout.cellCount` (Unicode scalars, precomposed first) rather than `String.count`, whose grapheme
  clusters disagree on every combining mark and ZWJ emoji. Neither side counts display columns, so a
  double-width glyph overflows the frame — accepted, not fixed.
- It skips a repaint whose frame is byte-identical to the last, so a spinner-less panel writes once and
  stops waking the renderer, and traps WINCH to invalidate that cache. This is a cache, not a measurement:
  the box still comes only from the body file.
- The helper stops on either the file disappearing or a builtin `kill -0` on that pid failing. The pid is
  the only stop a HARD-killed app has: `destroySurface` never runs, so the body file survives, and no SIGHUP
  arrives because the pty's session leader is the surviving `login`. Without it every crash, `kill -9` and
  XCUITest `terminate()` leaves a 2-10 Hz repaint loop running forever.
- `surface.zoom show|hide|toggle` reparents exactly one surface below a slim titlebar. Explicit IDs are
  `surface:<session-id>:<left|right|scratch|overlay|overlay-left|overlay-right>`, including hidden live
  panes. The active target is the single case `TerminalZoomSurface.isActive` accepts: the session overlay,
  then scratch, then the focused pane's own overlay, then that pane. Those
  predicates are mutually exclusive and total, resting on `Session.focusedPane`, so widening one without
  narrowing its neighbour silently picks the wrong surface.
- `surface.cursor` reports a zero-based COLUMN and nothing else, nested as `result.cursor.column` so a `row`
  could join it additively; the human form is the bare integer and must stay one value. libghostty exports no
  cursor accessor, so the column is solved for: `ghostty_surface_ime_point` gives the cell midpoint including
  an unknown padding term, and reading the viewport's top-left cell MEASURES that term as
  `ghostty_text_s.tl_px_x`, which cancels. Verified exact under asymmetric `window-padding-*` with
  `window-padding-balance`, across font sizes, on both split panes and on a hidden background session.
  There is NO row, and the vertical twin is not a near miss to be finished later: `tl_px_y` is the text
  BASELINE against an IME point at the cell bottom, and `adjust-font-baseline = 30` was measured reporting
  row 5 for a caret on row 4 while the column stayed right — a silent off-by-one, so a row waits for a real
  accessor. Use `TerminalZoomSurface.surface(in:)`, never a second inline switch over the six slots.
- It shares `surface.zoom`'s target vocabulary AND its gates, which is not cosmetic: `active` must consult
  the window's `TerminalZoomRegistry` target BEFORE the store's focused pane, or zooming a nonfocused pane
  reads the hidden one; and both paths must pass `TerminalZoomController.isTargetValid`, or a guessed
  `surface:<id>:overlay` reads a HUD the tree omits and zoom rejects. `quick` gates on
  `QuickTerminalController.isVisible`, not on `currentSurface()`, which `hide()` deliberately keeps alive.
  All three shipped as bugs once; `ControlSurfaceCursorUITests` pins each.
- It is a pure read that adds NO tree field, a deliberate exception to the state-command read-back rule
  (it sets no state) and to the temptation to project it: `ghostty_surface_read_text` allocates and takes the
  renderer lock, so paying it per live and hidden surface on every tree poll is the wrong trade.
- `quick` is the one target that names no window surface: it grows the quick-terminal PANEL to fill its
  screen. `setSurfaceZoom` routes it before resolving a window, so it takes no `--window` and never reaches
  `resolveSurfaceZoom`; it is refused `surface not available: quick` while the panel is hidden, and an
  omitted `--target` never resolves to it. See [[windows]].
- Host-free `TerminalZoomController` owns mode/state. Zoom must not change ratios, focus, sidebar, or pane
  visibility; deck slots remain constant and focus reporting is suppressed. Opening closes palette/search;
  banner reveal and Command-W exit. Font remains live. Reject search-open while zoomed, but keep hides
  idempotent even if the target vanished. Zoom neither closes nor blocks the quick terminal any more — the
  panel floats above every window instead of being hosted by one, so `quick show` is no longer refused with
  `terminal zoom active`. Read
  top-level live `zoomedSurface`; surface node active/visible describes pane state, not zoom.
- `dashboard` opens explicit IDs or `--mru`, or closes. Font-size and auto-size are exclusive; close accepts
  no IDs/MRU/font; open needs IDs or MRU; fixed size must be finite positive.
- A split expands to primary and split `DashboardMember`s, unless the id carries a `:left`/`:right` suffix
  (#331) selecting one pane. Host-free `DashboardTarget` owns that grammar: split on the FIRST colon,
  accept `primary`/`left`/`top` and `split`/`right`/`bottom` case-insensitively while readback stays
  `left`/`right`; reject `scratch`/`overlay` and a pasted `surface:<id>:<pane>`. The dispatcher rejects bad grammar outright; a
  well-formed ref naming no pane (`:right` without a split) is a soft miss joining `unresolved`.
- Resolve targets in order and deduplicate by session+pane, then cap panes app-side at
  `DashboardLayout.maxCells` 9. Append dropped-pane text to unresolved text with `;`. Guard emptiness on the
  EXPANDED members, never the resolved ids: with pane refs they diverge, and opening on an empty set clears
  zoom and silently closes a live dashboard. MRU takes up to nine valid recency entries before expansion and
  errors on an empty window.
- `closePrimaryPane` promotes a split survivor into the primary slot, so `DashboardController`
  `promoteSplitMember` rewrites that session's `.split` cell to `.primary` from `agtermApp.handlePaneExit`.
  Reconcile cannot do this: `closeSplit` and `closePrimaryPane` leave identical `hasSplit == false` state,
  and only the exit path knows which happened.
- Dashboard is per-window and view-only; GUI Command-Shift-G/menu/palette toggles MRU auto-size.
  Arrows navigate ragged `ceil(sqrt(n))` grid, Enter closes then selects/focuses exact pane, Esc closes.
  It is reciprocal with zoom. Read live `dashboardMembers`, highlighted member, applied font size, and
  `auto|fixed|untouched` mode. See [[libghostty]] for reparent, input gates, and transient font.
- `pick.open` accepts 1...1000 unique ID items with nonempty labels, or an empty list when `allowCustom`
  is set, which makes it a text prompt. Absent items return `pick.open requires items`; an empty list
  without `allowCustom` returns `pick.open requires at least one item`.
  Optional subtitle/prompt/query/custom/follow; `query` prefills the field so the picker opens filtered.
  Optional `selection` (CLI `--select ID`, its own field because `ControlArgs.select` is the Bool behind
  `session.type --select`) must name a supplied item, refused `pick select must name an item id`
  otherwise, an `allowCustom` empty list included (without `allowCustom` the at-least-one-item guard
  answers first). The palette seeds its highlight from it ONCE, against the first
  filtered list, so a `query` prefill that hides the item leaves the first visible row; later query
  edits keep the reset-to-zero behavior. Consumed at open like `query`, so it has no tree read-back: the
  result's `id`/`index` report what was picked, and `ControlPickUITests` pins that a far-down row is
  scrolled into view before Return.
  Reject duplicate IDs and control characters host-free; `prompt` and `query` stay unvalidated free text.
  Picks share the window modal slot with GUI asks. Terminal asks use separate session slots.
  A background window is raised only when `follow` is set.
- Caller-supplied rows match on their label only. Subtitles are displayed but never searched, so
  consequence text cannot filter a safe row out and leave a destructive one preselected. An empty query
  preserves caller item order; a prefilled `query` re-ranks and drops that order. The palette trims
  whitespace and newlines before deciding, so a blank `query` counts as empty — `fuzzyScore` consumes a
  newline the trim would otherwise keep, scoring every row 0 and losing the order to the A→Z tie-break.
- Global picker ID pins result/cancel to its owner across frontmost changes; explicit window must match.
  Results are pending, picked with ID/label/index, custom with query, or cancelled. Cancel is idempotent
  after terminal state. Tree exposes `pickPending`.
- Selection/custom/Esc/Command-W/window close resolve. App termination may race polling. Retain eight
  finished pick results per controller; on unregister move them into a 32-entry app-wide oldest-first store so
  deletion does not lose a pending poll.
- CLI reads JSON array when stdin begins `[`, otherwise nonblank lines become ID=label. Blocking poll is
  100ms for one second, then 500ms; print bare result JSON; exit 0 picked/custom, 2 cancelled, 1 failure.
  `--no-block` prints picker ID JSON; result/cancel are one-shot commands.

- `ask.open` accepts a nonblank `title`, optional `message`, and 1...6 `buttons` with unique ids and
  nonempty labels. Title, message, and labels reject control characters. Optional button `hotkey` is
  one ASCII letter, unique case-insensitively and stored lowercase.
- `defaultButton` and `destructiveButton` name supplied ids and cannot name the same button.
  Default seeds the highlight; otherwise the first non-destructive button is selected, or the first
  button if it is the only choice. Tab/Right/Down move forward, Shift-Tab/Left/Up move back, and wrap.
  Return chooses the highlight; a letter hotkey chooses directly. Outside clicks leave the dialog open.
- Optional `style` is `terminal` (default) or `gui`; invalid values return `unknown style`.
  Style selects ownership, default placement, and appearance. It has no separate read-back field.
- Optional `align` is `left`, `center`, or `right` (default). It aligns the whole button block, including
  the vertical fallback, in both styles. Invalid values return `unknown align`; it has no read-back.
- Both styles fit their content, capped at 90 percent of the anchor width and 72 cells.
  Narrow layouts wrap labels and use the vertical button fallback.
- Optional `width` fixes the panel width to an integer percentage of the anchor, 10...100, in either
  style. It replaces automatic sizing and has no read-back. Invalid values return `width must be 10 to 100`.
- Terminal buttons use padded labels and a dim fill from the theme foreground at low opacity.
  The active button uses solid foreground fill with background-colored text. Colors come from the theme.
- GUI style uses the picker's material, corner radius, and appearance handling, with system fonts,
  a headline title, secondary message, and native push buttons in a row. The active button is
  prominent in the accent color; destructive is tinted red and becomes prominent red when active. System colors only, so light and dark follow the picker.
- A terminal ask occupies `Session.askPending`, one per session, independently of the HUD/program
  overlay slot. A second terminal ask in that session returns `ask already pending`.
  A GUI ask occupies `PickController.pendingAsk`, sharing the window modal slot with pick. Terminal
  asks can coexist with GUI asks and picks. GUI asks participate in the shared window modal gates.
- Without `target`, terminal style uses the selected session in the requested window. An explicit
  unselected session is accepted without changing selection; its ask is hidden and pending.
  Terminal `pane`/`paneID` selectors can omit `target`. GUI style without `target` centers over the
  window's terminal area, excluding the sidebar. An explicit GUI target must be selected in its window;
  GUI pane selectors require it. Zoom/dashboard reject anchored GUI opens.
- A pane must be laid out by its session at open, independently of session selection. A live pane token
  overrides the role; an unknown token uses the supplied role or errors without one. `follow` raises
  the owning window without selecting another session. `ask.open` echoes the resolved role in `result.pane`.
- A terminal ask covers only its session or pane. It takes keys when that region is laid out, its
  session and covered pane are selected, and its window can receive input. GUI asks, picks, palettes,
  sidebar rename, and the quick terminal take priority. Active text editors retain input until they resign;
  palette dismissal ends editing before focus restoration. Clicking the covered region focuses its dialog;
  answering an unfocused ask does not pull focus.
- Terminal asks draw above program overlays, pane overlays, and the HUD within their region.
  A session-wide ask draws above the scratch; a pane ask hides under it. Zoom and dashboard hide terminal
  asks without resolving them. Deselecting a session or hiding its pane also keeps the ask pending.
  Hidden asks own no input and return when their region is displayed. Geometry follows resize and the
  captured pane identity through swaps and survivor promotion.
- Terminal asks cancel synchronously before session close (hard or soft, single or batch), workspace
  removal (hard or soft), destruction of their exact target pane, window close/removal, or app termination.
  Undo restores the session without its ask. A session-wide ask survives a sibling pane closing while
  the session remains. GUI asks cancel on window teardown or anchor loss, including session deselection
  or loss of the anchored pane's identity or rendered role.
- Esc and Command-W dismiss the ask that owns input with `escaped`. `ask.cancel` and owner teardown
  return `cancelled`. Result/cancel use the exact global ask id; an explicit window must match its owner,
  including for retained results. Cancelling a retained finished result is a successful no-op.
- `AskRegistry` indexes both live owner types. Open the owner's slot before registering the id, and retain
  the result before clearing the slot. Pending requests are never evicted. Finished results keep their
  owning window in one 32-entry cache across both styles, ordered by resolution. `PickRegistry` retains
  pick results separately.
- Blocking CLI output is `{"result":"answered","id":"yes","label":"Yes","index":0}`,
  `{"result":"escaped"}`, or `{"result":"cancelled"}`; index follows caller order.
  Exit 0 means answered, including a No button; exit 3 means escaped, exit 2 means cancelled,
  and exit 1 means failure. `--no-block` prints `{"id":"…"}`.
  One-shot `ask result` also prints `pending` and exits 1 for it.
- A session node exposes its session-slot ask as `ask: {id, pane?, remote?, replica?}`: a local terminal
  ask, or a handed-over ask of either style (see Remote sessions); `pane` is the current left/right role
  and is omitted for session-wide placement. Top-level `askPending` identifies the window's pending GUI ask.
  Each field is omitted when its slot is empty. App shutdown can interrupt polling.
  Ask emits no events; result and tree polling are its explicit event exemption.

## Status, notifications, and flags

- `session.status` accepts idle/active/completed/blocked, blink, auto-reset, optional sound, `#rrggbb`
  color, fixed shape set, and pane. Build a fresh ephemeral indicator so omitted overrides clear.
- Validate sound before mutation and target playback. `default`/`beep` beeps; named system/custom sounds
  use cached `NSSound`. Without per-call sound, entering blocked may play configured default once;
  repeated blocked does not. Explicit per-call wins via `AgentStatus.effectiveSound`.
- Resolving an uncached name runs off the main actor, so `setSessionStatus` is async and suspends there.
  It binds the target BEFORE that await, so a slow lookup racing a selection change cannot redirect
  `active`, and `unknown sound` still outranks a missing target.
  On resume it revalidates liveness: a session whose window closed or that moved stores mid-resolution is
  rejected rather than written. Pane ownership and `wasBlocked` are read at the mutation, never across it.
  A configured blocked default resolves after the write and cannot delay or reject it.
  The accept loop still waits: `handleConnection` runs inline and parks on `runBlocking`, so a cold lookup
  delays later commands. That is the price of answering `unknown sound` in the response, not an oversight.
  Lookups use their own serial queue, never `playQueue`, so one slow name cannot hold up playback.
- Validate color and shape before mutation. Shapes are circle, square, triangle, diamond, capsule, star;
  derive validation/help from `StatusShape.allCases`. Idle accepts but does not render shape.
  AppKit and SwiftUI resolve through shared color/symbol helpers.
- `ControlEventPayload` and `EventFormatter.human` must include every override; human status prints color
  and shape. Tree reports state, pane, true blink, per-call color, and per-call shape only while non-idle.
  It reports `statusChangedAt` whenever it exists, including idle.
- `statusChangedAt` is `Session.statusChangedAt` as epoch seconds — a plain `Double`, since
  `ControlProtocol.swift` imports no Foundation. It shares the `ControlEvent.ts` clock so a poller can
  compare the two, and `setAgentIndicator` stamps it BEFORE the unchanged-indicator early return, which is
  what makes every set, including idle and repeated values, refresh the age. Automatic and manual clears
  also count. Ephemeral: never persisted, absent before any set and after restore.
- Pane is left/right/scratch, nil meaning left. It controls pane-scoped keystroke clearing and GUI
  blocked/completed reveal. Control attention navigation changes selection only.
- Pane also decides PRECEDENCE while a session is blocked: a write from another pane that is neither
  itself `blocked` is refused whole with `blocked status owned by pane <pane>`, changing nothing and
  playing no sound. A hook's `active` must not erase the other pane's block. `blocked` from a second pane
  replaces (it is a real second request), `idle` is NOT exempt (the bundled hooks emit it unprompted from
  their own pane), and same-pane writes are unrestricted, so a
  single-pane session behaves exactly as before. `session.type` into the owning pane clears the block like a
  keystroke, an empty payload excepted. Two simultaneous blocks still collapse to one; see [[notifications]].
- `Session.paneAddress` owns `--pane-id` resolution for `session.text`, `session.type` and
  `session.restore`: a live token wins over `--pane`, an empty one counts as absent, and an unknown one
  without an explicit `--pane` answers `unknown pane id: <id>` rather than reaching a pane the caller
  never named. `session.status` alone keeps the plain role fallback. `session.text` and `session.type`
  report the pane they acted on as `result.pane`, the default-pane paths included.
- `session.type --pane-id` carries the token into the main pane's realize wait and re-resolves it before
  every probe. A pane that moved is typed into where it is, and one that is gone answers the unknown-id
  error, so a swap or a close during the wait cannot hand the keystrokes to another terminal.
- `surface.cursor --pane-id` takes a SESSION target (`active` or an id) and the token picks the pane.
  A surface id or `quick` beside it is refused, an unknown token always errors since there is no role to
  fall back on, and `result.id` is the resolved `surface:<session>:<position>`. `ControlActions` keeps
  the two-argument requirement and defaults the overload to refuse a token by name.
- Each tree surface node carries `paneID`, the live surface's token, omitted for a slot whose surface
  carries none (an overlay, or a pane whose surface is not created yet).
- `session.status --pane-id` (#199) falls back to the role for an absent or unknown token and adds no
  read-back field: it reports only the resolved `statusPane`.
- Auto-reset clears both session entered and session left. Status renders on selected sessions too.
- `session.flag on|off|toggle|clear` is idempotent; clear ignores target and clears the store.
  Read `flagged`.
- `session.seen` clears unseen without selection/focus/status or persistence. Read nonzero `unseen`.
- `session.context set TEXT|clear` sets what a session is FOR, shown in the title bar. Read `context`.
  `set` requires `text`, `clear` forbids it, and the mode is required, so a raw client sending both or
  neither is refused. The server trims outer spaces and rejects a blank result, over 256 UTF-8 bytes, or
  any control character or line/paragraph separator (U+2028/U+2029 included); a rejected call leaves the
  previous value standing, so `clear` is the ONLY route to unset. Persisted, surviving relaunch and
  restore, and never inherited by `session.duplicate`. A set or clear that CHANGES the value saves, and
  emits `tree.changed` when the shown value changed; re-setting the same value does neither. The tree's
  `context` is the shown value: an attached row also shows its origin's context, and the Remote sessions
  section owns that rule.

## Keymap, config, theme, and sidebar

- `keymap.run` starts a custom command by exact name against the addressed session, through the
  palette's `CustomCommandRunner.run` with that session in place of the active one. The parser keeps one
  command per name, so a name is the address; `CustomCommand.id` is minted per parse and never one.
  Ok means the process started: the command is detached, so its exit status is not the reply's, and a
  launch failure is an error carrying the reason.
- `keymap.reload` shares GUI reload and returns diagnostic count. `keymap.list` reports:
  resolved built-in actions and override state; live AppKit menu equivalents/menu/title/selector; path;
  custom commands with `repeats` and `errorHud` (booleans), `errorPosition` (canonical, default center), and optional
  `errorPane` (left/right, omitted for session-wide); diagnostics. Human rows show `--repeat` and opted-in error
  options. `repeats` is true, on an action or a command, only while its `--repeat` line kept a leader sequence.
  An action's `chord` is the menu key equivalent alone, so it keeps comparing
  against `menu`, while `alternates` holds its monitor-bound binds in kitty syntax and is omitted when
  empty; the human actions column joins the whole set with `|`. Both halves are canonical kitty syntax, not
  the file's own spelling — only a custom command's `shortcut` is preserved verbatim. `overridden` compares
  the MENU chord alone, so an action bound only by alternatives reports no override.
  The two chord sets may differ during deferred rebuild or collision.
  Host-free projection names arrow/return; represent AppKit globe as `fn+` even though grammar lacks it.
- `config.reload` shares GUI/Edit-overlay reload and returns Ghostty diagnostic count. Keymap and config are
  app-global and take no window.
- `hooks.reload` / `hooks.list` refuse a target or `--window` before any action. The user contract (file
  format, stdin/env delivery, queue, failures, reload) lives in `site/docs.html#hooks` and the read-back in
  `site/commands.html`; these are the implementation constraints. Hook identity is kind plus command text,
  never the line number, so `HookScheduler.apply` keeps an unchanged entry's child, queue and counters.
  Only process exit releases a hook's slot: a stdin delivery failure is recorded and bannered on the live
  run and never starts a second child, and `HookProcessRunner` reports `onExit` only after the child has
  terminated AND the `DispatchIO` cleanup handler has closed the write end. The scheduler's `onFailure`
  sink is the only banner source, one per hook until success or reload. `WindowLibrary.onControlEvent`
  fires after the ring append, so hooks and `events.read` see the same events; dispatch never waits on a
  hook, which is what makes a hook's own same-socket `agtermctl` call safe.
- `theme.set` operates on light and dark slots. Name/light aliases conflict; setting light preserves dark.
  Nil/empty means Ghostty built-in, while bare set clears both and disables sync. Dark enables sync,
  seeding missing light from current or Builtin Light; reserved `none` clears dark and sync but preserves
  light. Validate bundled names and return full post-state. Palette commits current appearance slot only.
- `theme.list` returns bundled names and plain or sync state. While syncing, omit plain theme and return
  light/dark. CLI marks active entries and includes `default ghostty`. Theme is app-global.
- `sidebar show|hide|toggle` is per-frontmost-window, persisted and animated from one root value.
  It shares titlebar, View, palette, and Control-Shift-Command-S behavior.
- `sidebar.mode tree|flagged|toggle` is frontmost and reads live `sidebarMode`.
- `sidebar.flagged-layout flat|tree|toggle` is APP-WIDE: no `activeStore` guard and no window target, since it
  writes the `FlaggedViewLayout` setting through `SettingsModel.setFlaggedViewLayout`, the seam the Settings
  picker uses, whose delta guard skips an unchanged value. `toggle` resolves from the effective setting and
  the response echoes the resulting layout in `result.text`. Read back as top-level `sidebarFlaggedLayout`
  on EVERY tree response, ordinary-tree windows included: `AppStore.controlTree` takes it as a parameter and
  `ControlServer.buildTree` passes the `GhosttyApp` mirror the sidebars render from. The legacy
  `controlTree(foreground:)` overload reports nil, meaning the host supplied none. An outside
  `ControlActions` conformer gets the unsupported-host default.
- `sidebar.expand` and `.collapse` target optional open window, post object-scoped store notifications, and
  no-op under the flat flagged list. Collapse preserves/scrolls active workspace. GUI forms are frontmost only.
- `sidebar.width <points>` targets an optional open window, unlike frontmost-only `sidebar`/`sidebar.mode`:
  it is per-window state and new commands do not inherit that limitation. Clamps to
  `AppStore.sidebarWidthMin...Max` through `clampSidebarWidth`, shared with the drag and the `restore()`
  clamp, and ECHOES the stored width as `result.sidebarWidth`, following `session.resize`, without which a
  clamped request and an honored one both read as bare ok. The echo is the STORED, clamped value, never a
  measured realized width, which a host laying the divider out under its own rounding can differ from. The
  CLI preserves it without fixed-decimal rounding, so a caller comparing request against echo cannot read a
  rounding as a clamp. That comparison is NUMERIC: the echo is the Double's own description, so `300` comes
  back `300.0` and equivalent spellings are not string-equal. Non-finite points are refused CLI-side and dispatcher-side. Read live `sidebarWidth`
  on the tree top level only. `ControlActions` DEFAULTS this arm in a public extension rather than requiring
  it, so a shared-dispatcher host outside this repo owes no conformance change; that does NOT make such a
  host build unchanged, since adding a `Command` case breaks any exhaustive switch over it first.
- `workspace.focus on` replaces/enables; off removes and disables on empty; toggle clears sole applied
  target or replaces/enables; add inserts without changing enabled state. There is no membership toggle.
  Clear Focus loops off over members; `workspace.filter off` only suspends.
- Read membership independently as `focused`. A workspace row is visible exactly when
  `sidebarVisible && ((sidebarMode == "tree" && (!workspaceFilter || focused)) ||
  (sidebarMode == "flagged" && sidebarFlaggedLayout == "tree" && one of its sessions is flagged))`.
  Preserve all terms and the parentheses. The control tree stays the unfiltered workspace/session model;
  never filter it to match what the GUI draws.
- `workspace.filter on|off|toggle` targets optional window, changes only enabled state, and refuses to
  enable empty membership. Read live top-level `workspaceFilter`.
- Focus/filter/mode/flag narrowing reselects the most recent visible session. Growing an empty visible set
  may also repair selection; flag clear and no-select creation do not.
- `workspace.collapse`/`.expand` persist model first, then post view-sync notification so hidden sidebar
  state is not lost. Coordinator updates tracked expansion under suppression. Read omitted/true `collapsed`.
- `workspace.new --collapsed` starts collapsed and does not reveal into focus membership. Plain create
  remains visible. Workspace adapters stay in `ControlServer+WorkspaceCommands.swift`.

## Tree and window read-back

- `version` and the tree's `app` are two projections of ONE `AppIdentity`, built once in the app target
  from `Bundle.main` and passed in. Nothing below the app target reads `Bundle.main`: a hosted test would
  see its own host bundle and the projections would drift apart. The same value feeds
  `SurfaceEnvironment`'s `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`, so the three can never disagree.
- `app.version` is the comparable number a cookbook recipe's minimum is checked against; `app.commit` is
  diagnostics and never part of that comparison. `app` is the only CONSTANT on the tree top level. It is
  absent from `window.list` because it describes the app rather than a window and duplicating it there
  buys nothing — NOT because a cache would stale it, which cannot happen to a constant. A caller with no
  tree uses `version`.
- `agtermctl version`'s `client:` line is HUMAN OUTPUT ONLY. `--json` stays the raw `ControlResponse` like
  every other command; a client-reported path in the protocol would be a field the server cannot vouch
  for. Resolve it with `_NSGetExecutablePath` + `realpath`, never `argv[0]`, and never print it after a
  server error.
- A keymap- or palette-launched process inherits the APP's launch environment, not a surface's, so it has
  no `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` (`CustomCommandRunner` merges `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment` with the
  `AGT_*` context only). That is why a recipe preflight uses `agtermctl version` rather than the variable.

- `splitCwd` reports `cwd(for: .right)` while `hasSplit` is true, shown or hidden. It falls back from
  the last reported split cwd to its restored initial cwd, then the primary effective cwd. Omitted without
  a split or on older servers; it is model read-back, not a fresh process query. `title` stays the raw
  primary OSC title; exposing `splitTitle` is deferred.
- `window.resize` echoes the applied frame size after `setFrame`, rounded to integer points like
  `window.list` geometry, as `result.width`/`result.height`. Human output is `W H`.
- Session nodes include foreground/split foreground argv, idle shell basenames, background spec, overlay
  size, pane overlays, split axis, split ratio, split focus, status fields, flag, unseen, restore pins,
  surfaces, `realized`, `backedByZmx`, `remoteHost`, and `liveAttribution`/`splitLiveAttribution`.
- `foregroundShell`/`splitForegroundShell` name the RECOGNIZED shell HOLDING a pane's foreground, present
  exactly when that pane's `foreground` is absent because a shell holds it.
  For a pane that EXISTS, neither field means agterm could not determine the foreground state — a bare nil
  foreground alone conflated the two, which `cookbook/park-and-resume` documents as a data-loss limit: an
  unreadable pane is parked as idle and replayed as a plain shell. Consult `hasSplit` before interpreting the
  split pair: with no split pane both are absent because there is no pane, and `hasSplit` is itself omitted
  when false. Do not make `hasSplit` always present to compensate.
- The pair is NOT proof of an interactive prompt and must never be treated as permission to type. A builtin
  such as `read` or `vared`, and a shell loop, run inside the shell process, so argv stays the shell's and a
  pane blocked on input is indistinguishable from one at a prompt; libghostty exposes no OSC 133 mark, so agterm
  has no prompt signal to offer instead. This is why the field says `foregroundShell` rather than naming
  idleness. Recognized is `CommandRestore.knownShells` plus `$SHELL`; a shell outside both reports in
  `foreground` like any program, and widening that set is NOT the fix — `paneForeground` is the one
  classifier behind both the tree read and the restore capture, so it would change what restore re-runs too.
  The basename comes from `stripLoginDash(argv)[0]`, in that order: `basename` splits on `/`, so it drops the
  login mark from `-/bin/zsh` but keeps it on the bare `-zsh`.
- `remoteHost` names the machine a teleported session is attached to and is omitted for a local one. It is
  live-only: a remote session is never persisted, so it cannot survive a relaunch.
- `backedByZmx` on a session is true only when every existing primary/split pane is currently backed.
  Primary/split entries in `surfaces` report their own Boolean; scratch and overlays omit it. Older servers
  omit both levels. There is no sidebar indicator.
- `liveAttribution`/`splitLiveAttribution` report the observed responsibility attribution of a local Live
  pane's leader process, probed from `sessionLeaderPIDs`: `supervisor`, `app`, `orphaned` or `unknown`,
  from `SessionHost.classify`. Omitted for a non-Live or remote pane; the split field covers a hidden
  split. `windows.md` owns the host lifecycle behind them.
- `realized` reports the MAIN pane's `TerminalSurface.isRealized`, populated host-free in
  `AppStore.controlTree` (no app closure — `isRealized` is on the protocol) and false for an empty slot, so
  only a server predating the field omits it. It exists because `session.new` answers `ok` for a model
  insert while libghostty refuses to create a surface with the display asleep, leaving a scheduled job's
  session unrealized until the displays wake (#416). It is the main pane because that is what `--command`
  spawns on and what `session.type`/`session.text` address by default; per-pane liveness stays with the
  `fontSize`/`splitFontSize`/`scratchFontSize` triple, so do not add a second per-pane spelling.
  `agtermctl tree` tags the row `(not realized)`, beside `(split hidden)`. Foreground shares the
  restore capture's pid/sysctl/host-free extraction but adds one step the capture must never take.
  libghostty's foreground pid is `tcgetpgrp`, a process GROUP id, and a pane with no job-control shell
  leaves its program in the group led by setuid-root `login`, whose argv `KERN_PROCARGS2` refuses. The tree
  read (`ForegroundProcess.running`) descends to the leader's own CHILDREN, lowest pid first, so a
  `--command` pane reports what it runs while a pipeline sibling under `sudo` and a post-pid-wrap
  grandchild stay out; a group whose leader already exited has no parentage to test, so every survivor
  qualifies. The capture (`.command`) stays leader-only, because a non-nil capture sets `hadForeground`,
  which preempts `initialCommand` in `restorePlan` and would drop the exec path.
- Top-level tree includes idle/auto-follow, live sidebar visibility/mode/width, workspace filter, quick
  visibility, zoom, dashboard, pick, and GUI ask state. Prefer live tree sidebar state over cached window list.
  `sidebarWidth` is tree-only: nothing needs width discovery across windows, which is all the cached
  `window.list` copy would add.
  `quickVisible` and a `quick` `zoomedSurface` are APP-level, so every projected window reports the same
  value for them; the rest stay per-window.
- Window nodes include open/active, open-store sidebar/auto-follow, geometry, fullscreen, zoomed, minimized.
  Closed live fields are omitted. Geometry is top-left display-relative y-down and round-trips move/resize.
- Window list is cached. Refresh after commands and frontmost/sidebar/attachment/move/resize/fullscreen/
  minimize changes. Ignore `Notification` payloads rather than carrying non-Sendable values into main actor.
  Minimized is live-only; restoration always reopens unminimized.
- Exact window behavior, readiness, cache ordering, and GUI interaction are owned by [[windows]].

## Restore commands

- `restore.capture` fills those same captured main/split slots on demand, from every open window's live
  panes, saves immediately, and captures no hidden split. It is app-global. It reports the slots it
  actually WROTE in `result.count` plus its own `result.text`; counting the slots afterwards instead would
  read a stale split capture as a fresh one. It runs only when `rerun` is configured for the next launch;
  configured `none` and `live` refuse and name that mode. This is the one place the API does not follow
  `session.restore`'s note-and-succeed behavior: see [[settings]] for why the two differ and for the exits
  the command exists for.
- `restore.clear` clears captured main/split foreground commands across open windows and saves immediately.
  It never clears durable `initialCommand`; it is app-global and works in every mode.
- The captured slots are deliberately NOT a read surface: neither command exposes what is armed, and the
  tree's `foreground`/`splitForeground` answer from the LIVE process, never from the slot. They read nil for
  an armed capture whose command has since exited, and nil again in the pre-mount launch gap where the
  pending slot is armed and no surface exists yet; the opposite pairing, a live command with nothing armed,
  is the ordinary mid-run state. `result.count` answers for the one call that wrote it and nothing else.
  BOTH commands therefore acknowledge only a checked save, since an ok over a failed write leaves state no
  caller can read back. Whether the slots become readable is a decision for `restore.capture` and
  `restore.clear` together, never bolted onto one of them.
- `session.restore` pins per-session, per-pane next-launch behavior for discussion #264:
  - nil/unpin/clear uses capture;
  - empty/pinNone/none forces plain shell and suppresses capture plus initial command;
  - command/set types that shell line.
- Pins persist and repeat each launch until changed, but never affect the live shell. Keep persisted
  `restoreCommand`/`splitRestoreCommand` separate from one-shot pending slots. Only bootstrap copies pins
  to pending; factories take-and-clear pending. Never let factories fall back to persisted values.
- `CommandRestore.restorePlan` owns precedence. Honor the immutable `rerun` launch mode, bypass
  denylist for deliberate pins, and type text verbatim. Document that persisted shell code may enter
  history and must not contain secrets.
- Reuse command/mode/pane/paneID. Validate mode, required set command, no control characters including tab,
  maximum 1024 UTF-8 bytes, and left/right/scratch. Shell metacharacters are allowed.
- Pane ID resolves first. Unlike status, unknown pane ID without an explicit pane errors to avoid writing
  main accidentally. Reject scratch and right without a split.
- Save checked and roll back memory on failure; report that the previous value remains. This durable shell
  payload must never acknowledge an unsaved clear. Outside `rerun`, successful set and none save policy for
  a future rerun launch and return a note naming the active mode; clear works without a note in every mode.
  None of these commands opts one session out of `live`.
- Promotion moves persisted and pending right pins to main; split close clears both. Soft-close paths clear
  pending before retaining objects; duplicate copies neither.
- Seed pending only at the three library bootstrap paths. Seed split pending state when the snapshot restores
  a shown or hidden split. A hidden split keeps its identity and pin until its pane is shown.
- Tree reads persisted pins, including empty string, never pending state.

## Restore mode and the zmx group

- `restore.mode` reads the policy bare and writes it with a mode argument. The status carries five fields
  because two "requested" values exist once the mode can change mid-run: `configured` is what the NEXT
  launch will ask for, `requestedAtLaunch` what THIS one did, `active` what it got. `restartRequired` is
  derived from the first two rather than reported separately, so no producer can disagree with it.
  `unavailableReason` appears ONLY when live was actually requested and refused — `RestoreLaunchDecision`
  carries a probed reason even under `none`/`rerun`, and reporting it there tells a rerun user their shell
  is unsupported for a mode they never chose.
- Modes and every zmx enum travel as raw STRINGS. `RestoreMode`'s decoder is deliberately lossy so a
  settings file from a newer build is not discarded, and reusing it on the wire would make a stale CLI
  print a future mode as `none` — the mode whose next launch reaps every daemon. The dispatcher parses
  strictly instead and refuses an unknown mode by name. Same reason the zmx states are strings: a strict
  enum would make one future value fail the WHOLE response.
- Setting the mode changes nothing this launch, and that is not a shortcut: a pane is wrapped in a daemon
  or not at the moment it is created, so no setting can retrofit a running shell. The host rolls memory
  back on a failed write, following `AppStore.setRestoreCommand` — acknowledging a policy the disk
  rejected promises a next launch that is not coming.
- `restore.mode` is a deliberate read-back EXEMPTION from the state-setting rule: it reports through its
  own bare read and as `zmx list`'s header, not through a tree or window node. The mode is app-global and
  latched per process, so a per-window node would repeat one constant on every row.
- The zmx commands need a running instance. Only the app can join live stores, pending-close records,
  checked closed-window snapshots, the directory-versus-index comparison and the observed daemons into one
  answer; a standalone reader sees neither pending-close nor live-model state. There is no app-down path
  and no hybrid fallback, which would report a weaker truth under the same command name.
- `zmx.screen` reads a daemon by the NAME `zmx list` prints, never by session: the session resolver sees
  only open stores, and closed-window and unindexed daemons are the point of the command. It is not a
  `session.text` fallback, whose default is the pane's own scrolled viewport; a daemon has no scroll
  position and answers at its last leader's grid. It attaches nothing and moves no lead.
- `zmx list` is the primitive; `prune` and `kill` act on rows it has already explained. Rows are the UNION
  of observed daemons and expected claims, so a leaked daemon and a pane whose daemon vanished are both
  visible. `state` is claimed/orphan/unknown/conflicted/pendingClose/foreign and `observation` is
  running/unreadable/absent — separate, because `clients == nil` alone cannot tell a gone daemon from one
  zmx failed to read. A closed window's panes are claimed with ZERO clients: that is the resting state,
  not a leak, so the client count alone never implies an orphan.
- The claim walk never writes. It is its own non-mutating pass rather than `PaneIdentityInventory.upgrade`,
  which mints missing identities and whose every caller saves; a missing identity makes the walk incomplete
  instead. It enumerates `windows/*.json` and compares against the index, because `bootstrap()` only scans
  the directory when `loadIndex()` returns nil — a valid-but-stale `windows.json` would otherwise leave a
  surviving window file unread and its panes reading as orphans. A directory it cannot enumerate is
  incomplete, never empty.
- `prune` is conjunctive: complete inventory, conflict-free ownership, an identity no pane claims, and a
  daemon observed detached. It is CHECKED AND REVALIDATED, never atomic — pinned zmx has no
  kill-if-detached, `--force` is consulted only when the connection fails, and a successful connection
  kills regardless of clients. So it re-lists immediately before mutating and drops anything that gained a
  client; a client attaching from outside agterm in the remaining gap can still be terminated, and the docs
  say so. It never passes `--force`, whose failed-connection branch unlinks a socket and exits zero,
  possibly leaving a live unresponsive daemon unreachable by name. Success counts ONLY the exact
  `killed session NAME` line, which zmx prints after draining to EOF.
- `zmx kill` requires an explicit target, pane and `--force`, and the dispatcher refuses without any of
  them before the host is called. Not because other close commands are recoverable — `session.close` is
  already immediate and `session.split.close` has no Reopen path — but because this destroys a backend
  process reaching a claim no window shows and every client attached to it. Resolution runs against the
  INVENTORY rather than `ControlTargetResolver`, which searches open stores only; `--window` scopes the
  claims before the session resolves. `absent`, `unreadable`, `pendingClose`, `unknown`, `conflicted` and
  `foreign` rows are all refused.
- After a successful kill the app marks the surface's exit handled through the existing
  `didHandleProcessExit`, never a parallel flag, and only AFTER the kill so a failed one leaves the natural
  path working. It then runs `agtermApp.handlePaneExit`, which owns the model transition plus the promoted
  survivor's font callback, its dashboard membership and the refocus — a store-only transition skips all
  three. `alreadyFinalized` threads down the close chain so the teardown does not ask zmx to kill a name
  already gone. The suppression is gated on `backedByZmx`: a requested-live launch that fell back keeps its
  claimed daemons while each pane runs a plain shell, so an ungated kill would close a pane that never
  attached to what it destroyed.
- `zmx.reset` is Agterm ▸ Reset Live Sessions… without the dialog, and both run `LiveResetCoordinator`.
  The dispatcher refuses without `--force` before the host; the coordinator then refuses, in order, when
  Live is not both the configured and the launched mode, when the listing failed, when the claim walk is
  incomplete or claims a pane twice, and when no pane is selected.
  `LiveReset.select` in agtermCore joins `paneClaims()` to the listing; the dialog counts distinct sessions
  and the reply carries `result.liveReset` (sessions, panes, pending, and `outdated` sessions when any) plus
  the dialog body as `text`.
- A pane is selected for one of two reasons, carried on each marker target. `outdated`: its daemon's
  `created=` from `zmx list` is before the launch's `ZmxBuildRecord` cutoff, whatever its attribution, which
  is what reaches supervised panes still running a zmx from before an update. `unsupervised`: otherwise, an
  orphaned or app-attributed leader. A pane that qualifies for both is recorded as `outdated`.
- `ZmxBuildRecord` is `zmx-build.json` in the state directory. The build phase copies `.zmx-build-stamp` into
  the bundle as `Resources/zmx/BUILD`; `restoredRuntime` compares it with the record before
  `LaunchOrchestration.run`, dates a different or missing id at the current whole second (zmx's `created`
  resolution), and hands the cutoff to the consumer and the control server. Every app update replaces and
  re-signs zmx, so a file time would flag every session after every update; only an id change moves the
  cutoff. The first launch with no record treats every existing session as outdated once. The cutoff proves
  only that a session predates the recorded change, so user text says "predate the last Live sessions update",
  never that it runs an older zmx. No bundled id means no cutoff and no outdated selection.
  The connection thread quits only after it has written the reply to THAT request, decided from the
  request being `zmx.reset` and the response being ok, never from shared state: remote workers write
  other replies in parallel and must not quit the app. A reply that could not be written leaves the reset
  pending for the menu or a later request.
  The quit writes `live-reset.json` in the state directory only after the exit capture ran and the
  checked snapshot save succeeded, then spawns the relauncher; a relauncher that cannot start removes the
  marker. The next launch consumes the marker before any kill and only NARROWS it: a target is killed when
  it is still claimed, still listed with the same leader pid, and still qualifies for its reason (created
  before the cutoff, or orphaned); gone restores normally; anything else is skipped. `consume` accepts marker
  versions 1 and 2, and a version-1 target reads as `unsupervised`. Every selected leader is polled whatever the batched kill reported, and a
  survivor's pane gets neither its replay nor its durable command at that launch.
  A confirmed reset arms and skips the quit alert only while Live is still both modes
  (`armablePending`): a mode change after confirmation leaves the next launch unable to suppress a
  survivor's ordinary seed. A launch that did not get Live discards a marker it finds without killing.
  The listing and the batched kill are clamped to the remaining budget, and a batch that cannot start
  before the budget expires leaves every selected pane suppressed. The Help item shows a refusal in user
  words through `presentRefusal`; only a cancel is silent.
  Read-back is `liveReset` on the tree top level and the `zmx list` header, omitted when nothing is
  pending and no launch consumed a marker. Each `zmx list` row carries `outdated: true` for a daemon created
  before the cutoff, omitted otherwise. XCUITest exemption: the command quits the app, so its
  coverage is hosted and package tests plus the isolated acceptance run, like `restore.mode`.

## Remote sessions

- `zmx.tree` lists another Mac's attachable sessions and `zmx.attach` opens one of them here. Each attach
  imports one session, its split included; whole-workspace teleport is out of scope, and several remote
  rows may sit side by side.
- A row carries what a PICKER needs, not only what attach needs. Without that a caller has to run a second
  ssh and join `agtermctl tree --json` by session id, paying another authentication for data the walk
  already held and discarded. The exact fields are below.
- A remote pane is an ORDINARY command surface whose command is ssh. There is no new surface kind, no new
  lifecycle and no remote daemon ownership, so closing locally tears the surface down, ssh dies, and the
  far-side daemon survives. No command asks the remote zmx to kill anything. `Session.remoteHost` is model
  metadata, and persistence, ownership, icon and factory routing all read it.
- A remote pane's reported cwd can be remote, so the local launches that inherit it go through
  `Session.localWorkingDirectory`: the reported path when it exists here as a directory, else HOME.
  Those are custom commands (execution cwd only; `AGT_SESSION_PWD` stays the reported path and
  `AGT_SESSION_HOST` carries the destination), scratch, the overlay default, the quick terminal, a
  local split (the first on an unsplit remote session, or one created after the attach-time split
  closes), Duplicate Session and a new session under the current-directory setting. The primary SSH
  surface still starts in HOME without the helper. `keymap.md` owns the token contract.
- A pane's zmx daemon applies ONE client's grid, its leader's. Which client leads is explicit; see
  Pane lead below.
- `zmx list` carries the `endpoint` header — the zmx executable and its `ZMX_DIR` — because neither is
  guessable from another machine. It is INJECTED from `ZmxClient` through the restored runtime, never
  recomputed from the process environment, which would duplicate runtime selection and break hosted tests
  that inject a client. Optional on the wire, so a remote reader tells an older server apart by absence and
  refuses rather than half-attaching.
- `zmx.tree`'s host is OPTIONAL, and that is the whole design. Bare, it builds this app's own attachable
  sessions across every open window; with a host, it sshes once and runs the BARE form on the far side.
  So the far-side operation is an ordinary public command a user can run and test on its own, there is no
  second "internal export" noun, and one document comes back already joined. Nothing is composed across
  two remote calls, which is what removed the framing marker, the two-sequential-calls race, and the
  extra authentication.
- The far side cannot know which name reached it, so `ControlRemoteTree.host` is stamped by the
  REQUESTING app after decoding and is the validated ssh destination it was given, never a self-reported
  hostname. It is absent from the bare local answer, which sshed nowhere.
- Still read the exit status BEFORE the output. `agtermctl --json` prints a not-ok response to stdout and
  exits nonzero, and an ssh that dies mid-write leaves output that may still parse, so an ok-looking
  payload from a nonzero process is never accepted.
- Scope is EVERY open window on the far side, keyed by a live store the way `openCounts` tests it. Rows
  are flat and carry `windowID`/`windowName` and `workspaceID`/`workspaceName`: show the names, group by
  the ids, because neither rename path nor `addWorkspace` enforces uniqueness, so two windows called
  `main` and a `dev` workspace in each are ordinary and name-grouping silently merges them.
- A session is offered only when the store reports `backedByZmx` AND every pane resolves to a `claimed`
  daemon observed `running` under an agterm daemon name. A claimed daemon alone proves nothing: a
  requested-live launch that fell back preserves its daemons while showing fresh shells. An incomplete
  split is dropped whole, never offered half. These are ELIGIBILITY rules, not only a defence against a
  race, so losing the two network reads does not retire them: the zmx observation is still a subprocess
  snapshot taken beside the model walk. They now run on whichever side owns the sessions, which is the
  far side for a remote call.
- An empty candidate list is a SUCCESSFUL answer and deliberately does not distinguish "not running live"
  from "live with nothing eligible". `zmx list` is the restore-mode diagnostic; no surface may claim the
  empty list diagnoses the mode.
- The attach argv appends a create-only guard command that exits nonzero. Stock `zmx attach` CREATES a
  daemon whose name is absent, so a daemon that vanished since the tree was read would otherwise hand back
  a fresh remote shell wearing the session's name. An existing daemon ignores the command; a vanished one
  runs it and fails visibly.
- The attach `env` sets the same FOUR variables the local pane sets in `ZmxSupport`: `ZMX_DIR` plus empty
  `ZMX_SESSION` and `ZMX_SESSION_PREFIX` and `ZMX_NO_DETACH_KEY=1`. Empty rather than `env -u` because zmx
  reads each as `getenv orelse ""` with a length check, so empty IS unset to it, and because one
  convention across both panes beats two spellings of one intent. An inherited `ZMX_SESSION` is the
  dangerous one: attach reads it first and SWITCHES session instead of attaching, never reaching the
  create-only guard. An inherited `ZMX_SESSION_PREFIX` resolves a name agterm never created, since its
  daemons are always unprefixed. The detach key is disabled for the same reason as locally — a detached
  pane has no way back. The tree read needs none of this: it goes through the far side's own app.
- Two ssh shapes. Tree uses `-T` plus an outer process deadline, `ConnectTimeout` bounding the handshake
  only; attach uses `-tt`, because a remote command does not reliably get a pty and zmx reads termios and
  window size, and carries no lifetime deadline. Both pass `BatchMode=yes`, so key-based non-interactive
  auth is a precondition and a host-key or password prompt is a failure rather than a question a
  dispatcher could answer. The host is refused rather than escaped; paths and the remote command are
  argv-quoted. The pane attach alone adds `LogLevel=ERROR`: ssh's disconnect chatter would land wherever the
  remote program left the cursor, while a takeover or an unowned reattach runs with no probe first, so a
  refused key or a changed host key must still print its reason.
  The pane wrapper also adds `ServerAliveInterval=5`/`ServerAliveCountMax=2` before the host when `ssh -G`
  reports `serveraliveinterval 0`, so a dead link ends within about 15 s, on the third missed check, unless
  the user's config sets a nonzero one. The check runs with the attach's own arguments, so a `Match command`
  or `Match sessiontype` block answers it the way it answers the attach, and a `Match exec` command runs
  twice per attach. An explicit `ServerAliveInterval 0` reads the same as unset and gets the default; a
  large value is the opt-out. When the pane's ssh joins an existing `ControlMaster` connection the options
  do nothing; that master's own settings decide.
- Neither the host nor the session target is echoed into an error unless it PASSED validation. `invalid
  host` is a constant, and `zmx.attach` refuses a session carrying EMBEDDED whitespace or a control
  character through the same `RemoteSession.isPlain` the argv builders use — outer whitespace is trimmed
  before the check — so the unresolved-session message can name the id it could not find. The later host
  interpolations are safe because reaching them means `treeCommand` already accepted it. JSON encoding
  escapes control bytes, so the protocol framing was never at risk; `agtermctl` decodes and prints to a
  terminal, which is what this closes. Remote-supplied error detail is deliberately NOT sanitized beyond
  an edge trim: an ssh failure is worth reading intact, and a chosen remote is the same trust model as
  running ssh by hand.
- The far side needs `agtermctl` on sshd's remote-command PATH — a machine merely running agterm has no
  CLI an ssh command can find, and the read fails with exit 127. sshd's compiled-in default is
  `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, so the tree chain APPENDS `CommandPath.standardDirectories`:
  `/usr/local/bin` where the Help action links, `/opt/homebrew/bin` where the cask does. Appending is what
  leaves a PATH deliberately supplied to sshd, and a custom agtermctl already on it, ahead of those two.
  State this precondition on every surface describing the setup, not only where it is demonstrated:
  `site/docs.html`, `site/commands.html`, `reference.md`, `SKILL.md` and `examples.md`.
- That chain travels as `/bin/sh -c '<chain>'` because sshd runs a remote command through the ACCOUNT's
  shell, where a bare `VAR=value` assignment is a syntax error in fish and tcsh — the whole read then
  fails before the first `agtermctl`, so it is not merely a PATH that failed to widen. `attachCommand`
  already followed the same one-command rule, reaching it through `/usr/bin/env ZMX_DIR=...` rather than
  an assignment. The account shell can also change under a running agterm: live-backed panes survive a
  `chsh` that a later sshd command then honors.
- The runner is async behind an injected seam. `ControlActions` is `@MainActor`, so a blocking wait would
  freeze the UI for the whole network deadline, and the fake is what lets the end-to-end tests run without
  a second Mac.
- Four commands leave the accept thread, in two ways. `zmx.tree` and `zmx.attach` wait on the network,
  so `handleConnection` moves each to a worker thread and that thread's descriptor close moves with it.
  `zmx.present` and `session.overlay.job.run` are streaming hand-offs: each is dispatched inline, its
  ordinary reply is written, and on ok the descriptor passes to a `ControlStreamOwner` whose reader thread
  is the only one that closes it. A remote `overlay.close` does not leave the thread: it replies at once.
  Everything else stays inline, because dispatch
  refreshes the window cache in the same execution the fast path reads. Running an ssh inline instead
  makes `zmx tree <this machine>` DEADLOCK: the far side's own `agtermctl` waits in the backlog this
  connection is holding. Local `zmx.list` blocks that thread too, on a subprocess bounded at 3s, and
  stays inline deliberately — contention is not deadlock. `ControlServerTests` pins the free accept
  thread by probing `window.list`, which the cache answers with no main-actor hop, so only a held ACCEPT
  thread can fail it.
- `zmx.attach` re-runs the remote resolution itself before touching the model, since a picker's answer can
  be minutes old. Discovery, endpoint validation, pane resolution and command construction are all
  pre-model failures leaving no half-built row; ssh itself starts AFTER insertion, so a transport failure
  is an ordinary pane exit on the held path. It matches the
  session by ID ALONE — remote names are mutable and non-unique across workspaces — and panes by role,
  never array position. The row is selected in the destination window's current workspace.
- `zmx.attach --window` resolves an open local destination after discovery, immediately before insertion.
  Omitted, it uses the then-frontmost window. An explicit invalid or closed window fails without creating
  a session; it never falls back or raises another window. The old `attachRemoteSession(host:session:)`
  witness remains callable. Hosts implementing only that form accept untargeted calls and refuse explicit
  window placement through the new overload's default.
- The local cwd is this machine's home, not the remote one: libghostty chdirs the pane process here and a
  path that exists on the far side may not exist locally. The attached shell reports its real cwd through
  the terminal stream.
- Both panes set `commandWait`/`splitCommandWait`, so `shouldCloseOnChildExitAction` returns false, Ghostty
  holds its own press-any-key prompt, and the wrapper's one sanitized line — host, session, pane, exit
  status — can be read under the last remote screen. The wrapper runs as `/usr/bin/env /bin/sh -c`, since
  libghostty's `exec -l` would otherwise replace the shell with ssh and drop it. On ssh's own 255 it instead
  resets the reporting modes the remote left on, shows a reconnecting bar naming the host, reports `RemoteLinkNotice` (`OSC 2;agterm-remote;<lead nonce>:lost`, intercepted beside
  `zmx-role;`) and waits on `cat`, which ends with the app's pty. The pane then never reaches `onExitHeld`;
  `PaneLead.linkLost` believes only the current attachment's nonce and runs the same `remotePaneStopped`
  cleanup. A failed probe's stderr is kept as the entry's `reason`, last non-empty line, sanitized and
  capped, replaced by every failure and nil when ssh said nothing; it is never classified, since an
  offline host and a refused login both exit 255 and the retry must not give up on either. The pane's
  child is `cat` with echo off, so nothing can be printed into it: `RemoteReconnectNote` inside
  `PaneLeadCover` draws the line and the surface node's `reconnect` reads it, both from the entry, so
  both go with the wait. `RemoteReconnectBook` probes (`RemoteSession.probeCommand`) on the remote tick with
  `RemoteRetryBackoff`, and a host that answers gets `reattachPane(claim: false)`, covered only when the
  origin had reported a role or the attach it replaced dropped before its first report, and
  `remotePaneResumed`. Re-running the attach in the shell was rejected: it
  would claim the lead on every retry and skip that cleanup. A key on a waiting pane retries now; Command
  chords pass. `RemoteLinkObserver` calls `ControlServer.retryRemoteLinksNow` on the display wake
  `SystemWakeObserver` bridges, which a dark wake or a headless Mac never posts, and on every
  `NWPathMonitor` path change that leaves the path usable, a hand-off that stayed usable included;
  the first path report is the state at start. That makes
  every waiting pane and dropped stream due now and starts their backoff over, so a probe fired before the
  network is back ramps from 1 s again instead of waiting out the 300 s cap. A key on a waiting pane goes
  through the same `retryNow` and starts the backoff over too.
  `session.reconnect` is the key's control twin: it retries a waiting pane, or parks a live one through
  `remotePaneStopped` + `waitToReconnect` so the probe loop attaches it afresh. `session.type` and
  `session.paste` into a waiting pane refuse with `pane is reconnecting`, as a covered pane refuses: the
  wrapper's `cat` drops the text. Reads and `session.selectall` stay available, the kept screen being the point.
  Read back `connection` on the primary/split surface node (`ControlRemoteConnection`): `stale` counts
  silence on `RemotePresentationState.lastAnswer` only while the stream is `connected`, past
  `ControlRemoteConnection.staleAfter` (one and a half origin pings, `RemotePresentationClient.pingInterval`,
  which the origin's heartbeat loop also reads), and is poll-only. A pane held on its exit line omits the
  field, its attach having ended; a waiting pane reads `reconnecting` with `retryIn` whatever its hold,
  while its streak and reason stay on `reconnect`.
  The held exit reaches the app at once through `onExitHeld`, which forgets the pane's lead and records the
  hold for remote layout, but it carries no ssh status: `/usr/bin/login` discards it. Each pane holding and
  closing on its own is also right when one half of a split dies.
- `session.selected` is emitted from `selectedSessionID`'s observer, so every writer gets it: direct
  assignments in close, undo and reopen paths included, not only `selectSession`. `restore(from:)`
  suppresses it, since a reload is not a selection. `addSession` emits `session.created` first.
  The selection is per window, so a window coming forward emits nothing, and `tree.changed` still does
  not fire on selection.
- `remote.opened` / `remote.closed` are emitted by `emitSessionCreated` / `emitSessionClosed` themselves,
  gated on `remoteHost`, never from `zmx.attach`: the attach inserts the row before ssh starts, and a
  soft close emits `session.closed` while the pane is still alive for undo, whose `session.created` never
  passes through the attach path. So the pair means row visibility only, every producer of those edges
  gets it, and no kind claims the ssh connection's state: the held exit says the command ended, never why.
  The host Mac gets no event for an attach; a host-side pair would be `client.attached` / `client.detached`,
  never these kinds.
- `Session.remoteHost` is immutable and set at construction, because `addSession` saves: a marker written
  afterwards would let one snapshot reach disk carrying the ssh command. `isPersistable` gates every
  producer — the launch snapshot, the Recent Closed session record, and a closed workspace's record, whose
  `sessionCount` and `selectedSessionID` are recomputed after filtering. The in-memory pending-close record
  keeps remote sessions, so the three-second undo still restores the row.
- `Session.locallyManagedPaneIdentities` is the single local-ownership predicate, empty for a remote
  session, read by `finalizePaneIdentities`, the direct `closeSplit` finalizer path, `liveClaims` and live
  `finalizeWindowPanes`. Without it `liveClaims` invents an `agterm-<uuid>` claim for a pane whose daemon
  is on another machine and the zmx commands resolve a session agterm does not manage. Structural
  `paneIdentity` stays valid either way: swap, promotion and control addressing still need it.
- `ZmxLaunch.wrapsLocally` is the one gate both surface factories read, so a remote pane is never wrapped
  in a local daemon. Wrapping buys nothing for a session that never restores, and under live mode window
  close would drop the local client while the daemon kept ssh connected with no UI showing it.
- Presentation carries status, context, notifications, the HUD and the layout of attached panes. Such a program runs
  on the origin and reaches the origin's socket, so without a stream the viewer sees terminal bytes only.
  Every attach opens one: the viewer runs `ssh -T <host> agtermctl zmx present <session>`, whose far end
  bridges stdio to a `zmx.present` connection. The far-side `agtermctl` PATH precondition above applies.
- The stream is newline-delimited JSON, `PresentationFrame` with `gen`, `rev` and a body. The hub registers
  a subscriber BEFORE it takes the snapshot and holds deltas until the snapshot is sent, so nothing falls
  between the two. A viewer drops a frame from another generation or an old revision, and skips an unknown
  kind without ending the stream, which is what lets a later kind reach an older viewer.
- `zmx.tree` advertises `presentation`, the protocol version. A viewer never launches the bridge against an
  origin that omits it and reports `unsupported`; nothing is retried and no warning is raised.
- Read-back is `presentation {state, mode, error}` on the viewer's session node and `presenters {mirrors}`
  on the origin's. `connected` means the PRESENTATION stream is up. It says nothing about the panes' own
  ssh connections.
- A `layout` frame and the snapshot's optional `layout` carry model pane identities, primary, axis and
  shown state, including an unrealized origin split. Invalid layouts are ignored without disconnecting.
  An older origin omits the field and leaves the viewer's layout alone.
- Axis, visibility and swaps follow the origin only for an existing, realized pair of mapped replicas.
  The viewer never creates a pane from a layout; newly opened origin splits require closing and attaching
  the row again. A locally closed replica stays closed, and local panes keep their layout. Ratio and
  keyboard focus stay local; hiding the split maximizes this Mac's focused pane.
- Confirmed removal closes a mapped replica without requiring acknowledgement, including one already
  held after ssh exited. If it is the last realized replica, it stays until its ssh exits, then the row
  may close and following stops. Automatic primary removal is skipped while a local split is pending.
  A layout never removes a local replacement. Losing the stream alone keeps the panes; an ordinary ssh
  disconnect still shows the disconnect line, held or reconnecting per the exit-255 bullet above.
- A mirrored status bypasses `applyControlStatus`: the blocked-owner rule already ran on the origin, and a
  second pass here would refuse a clear the origin accepted. The origin's pane travels as a stable pane
  identity and maps through `RemoteBinding`; one with no local counterpart maps to no pane, never to a
  neighbour. A non-idle status written locally takes the row over until a LIVE status update arrives from
  the origin, a same-value write included since the origin publishes those too. A snapshot does not end
  it: one arrives with every reconnect, so `applyRemoteSnapshotStatus` skips such a row, which also holds
  back an origin write made while the stream was down. A local clear leaves the row idle, and the next
  snapshot fills it.
- The origin's `session.context` is mirrored into `Session.mirroredContext`, never into the row's own
  `context`. The title bar and the tree's `context` show `effectiveContext`: the local value when one is
  set, else the mirrored one. A local value wins over snapshots and live updates alike, unlike status,
  and the mirror keeps updating underneath it, so `clear` on an attached row removes the local override
  and reveals the origin's latest context. It cannot blank the origin's. `tree.changed` follows the
  effective value: setting the text the mirror already shows emits nothing. Attach does not seed the
  context from `zmx.tree`, which would make the origin's label a local override that wins forever, so an
  origin predating the `context` frame mirrors none.
- A mirrored HUD carries the origin's REMAINING time, and the viewer counts that down on its own clock.
  The two expiries are not synchronized, so the panels can close a moment apart; the origin's withdrawal
  frame closes the viewer's early. A mirrored HUD yields to a HUD or program overlay this Mac's own caller
  opened, and never closes one.
- Only a `notify` command is mirrored. A terminal notification (OSC 9/777) already reaches the viewer in
  the pane's bytes and its libghostty raises it, so mirroring it would show it twice. Each app records
  its own `notify` event. Notifications are not part of the snapshot: one raised while the stream is down
  is never shown on the viewer, where status, context and HUD are restored on reconnect.
- When the stream ends, the mirrored status, context and HUD are cleared, since nothing would ever clear them. The
  client retries after 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 then 30 seconds, moves to a 300-second cap after eight failures in a
  row, and never gives up; 30 seconds without a frame counts as a failure against the origin's 10-second
  ping. One warning per failure episode or changed reason. A soft close stops the client and undo starts a
  fresh one.
- A stream a viewer opens asks for the PRESENTER role. The origin grants it to one stream per session and
  refuses the rest, which stay mirrors and ask again only on their own reconnect; an origin predating the
  role answers mirror. The role goes with its stream. Read back the viewer's `presentation.mode` and the
  origin's `presenters.presenter`. A newly opened session-associated ask or program overlay goes to that
  presenter only when its target pane reports `follower` on the origin, or every existing pane does for
  session-wide placement; mixed, unknown or unowned roles stay local.
  One already open stays where it is when the lead changes.
- An ask handed over keeps its slot and its id on the origin, which reads back `ask.remote`; the viewer draws
  a replica, `ask.replica`, whose answer carries only the button id and is checked against the stored
  buttons. It ends when answered or escaped on the viewer, or when the origin cancels it or tears down its
  session or pane, which dismisses the replica. The viewer refusing it (its slot is taken, or a GUI target is
  not on screen; a terminal replica for a hidden row waits hidden like a local one) or its stream being lost
  hands it back: the origin owns it again as an ordinary ask, pending until its target is shown, and one it
  cannot place ends `cancelled` with `reason: presentation-lost`, a field an older client ignores. A late
  answer from the former presenter is refused.
- An overlay handed over is a JOB. The origin reserves the slot, so the session stays uncovered here while
  no second overlay opens on it, and the viewer opens an ordinary overlay running
  `ssh -tt <origin> agtermctl session overlay run-job <job>`. That helper claims the job over
  `session.overlay.job.run`, which is the claim itself: one winner against a 30-second launch deadline,
  after which a late claim spawns nothing. The helper runs the program under the ssh terminal, in the cwd a
  local overlay would get and with agterm's session variables over the environment and `TERM` the ssh
  session gave the helper, and reports `started` and one outcome. The first outcome
  wins: the exit code where a local overlay keeps one, or `launch-failed` (refused, or nothing claimed it in
  time), `canceled` (closed, or the ssh went away) or `unknown` (the helper went away, or never reported
  starting), which does not prove the program stopped. A refused open ends `launch-failed`; nothing falls back to a local overlay, since the caller's
  program must run once. A command whose launch context exceeds the helper's 256 KiB frame is refused at
  open with `overlay command too large to show on another Mac`, before any job exists.
- `overlay.result` reads the slot. A non-exit outcome answers `overlay ended: <outcome>` as an error, so
  `--block` exits 1 for it; `--block` polls the slot, so an overlay opened on it before the next poll
  answers for it. The result is readable once the job ends, even while a held `--wait` surface on the viewer
  keeps the slot or a HUD opened here during the run holds the session-wide slot. The viewer's own `overlay.result` for such an overlay reports its local ssh and
  helper status; the origin's answer is the authoritative one.
- `overlay.close` on a remote overlay replies once the cancel is REQUESTED, not once the program ended;
  `overlay.result` reports how it ended. `overlay.resize` reaches only the stream the job was handed to and
  answers `the viewer showing this overlay is gone` without it. Both are best effort: what the viewer applied
  is not read back. `overlay.text` and `overlay.copy` refuse with `overlay is shown on another Mac`. Read the
  reservation back as `remoteOverlays` (`pane`, `sizePercent`) on the origin's session node.
- Losing the presenter ends its overlays for good: no later stream adopts one. An unclaimed job is cancelled,
  a held surface's slot is freed, and a running job keeps its slot until its helper reports, which the
  helper does when the ssh terminal goes. On the viewer a held surface closes at once and a running one
  keeps its program and closes when its ssh ends, held or not. A session leaving either store, soft close
  included, ends all of this before it goes, so undo brings back neither a reservation nor a replica.
- A row whose stream is not up says so on its sidebar indicator, naming the host. Retrying is automatic;
  closing and reattaching the session is the manual way to retry now.
- The origin bounds each stream: 256 KiB a line checked before delivery, a bounded outbound queue whose
  overflow closes the subscriber, a hello deadline, and a drop when the source session leaves.
- XCUITest exemption: `zmx.present` needs a second app as its peer, and its effects on a viewer are the
  existing status, context, notification, HUD and pane paths those suites already cover. `ControlServerRemotePresentationTests`
  runs both roles in one process over the real bridge binary instead.
## Pane lead

- zmx keeps one leader per daemon and applies only its grid. Stock zmx moves the lead to whichever client
  sends bytes it classifies as typing, which `session.type` on the origin is, and so is a terminal's reply
  to a Kitty keyboard-status query. `scripts/zmx-patches/0001-explicit-leadership.patch` adds an opt-in:
  a client attached with `ZMX_MANAGED=<nonce>` leads only by claiming at attach (`ZMX_MANAGED_CLAIM`), its
  input is dropped while it follows, and a resize from it never claims a vacant slot. Every attach agterm
  starts is managed; a stock client on the same daemon keeps upstream behaviour.
- `zmx.attach` claims in every pane, so the attaching Mac's grid applies with no key press. A local pane
  attaches WITHOUT the claim: it leads a daemon nobody leads, and one relaunched under another Mac's lead
  comes back covered instead of taking it.
- The client reports its role as a TITLE, `OSC 2;zmx-role;<nonce>:<unowned|leader|follower>:<generation>`,
  intercepted in `GhosttyCallbacks` ahead of `applyTitle`. Not OSC 777: libghostty drops a desktop
  notification that follows another within one second APP-WIDE (`Surface.zig showDesktopNotification`),
  which lost the report after every re-attach and would lose one of a split's two. The nonce is per
  attachment and the daemon unsets it before spawning the shell, so neither a program printing the title
  nor a report from a surface the pane already replaced is accepted; a program that enables
  `title-report` can read it back and forge its OWN pane's role, which is accepted.
- A static `title` in the user's ghostty config makes libghostty drop every OSC title, the reports
  included, while the daemon goes on enforcing a role the app never learned: a follower's
  `session.type` would answer ok for input the daemon drops. `GhosttyApp.clearStaticTitle` therefore
  clears the key in EVERY config build, reload and per-surface overlay included, keeps the string as
  `staticTitle`, and agterm applies it itself where libghostty used to: when a pane is wired, in place of
  every title a program sets, and to every surface on a reload.
- The client writes a report only where it cannot split an escape sequence or a UTF-8 character,
  tracked with Ghostty's own `Stream.nextSliceUntilGround`, and forces one with CAN after 250 ms. The
  daemon reports to a client only when ITS role changed, so CAN lands in a fresh terminal or one about to
  be covered, never in the continuing leader's.
- `ZmxLeadBook` holds the state, keyed by pane identity so it follows a swap or a promoted split.
  `lead` on each primary/split surface node reads it: `leader`, `follower`, `unowned`, and omitted until
  the pane's zmx reports. A pane with no daemon never does, which is every local pane outside Live
  sessions mode, and neither does an origin or a zmx without the patch. Such a pane behaves as
  before and is never covered. A role change emits `tree.changed`.
- A pane that does not lead is covered (`PaneLeadCover`), by every host of its terminal: the deck, where
  it sits BELOW the pane's own pane overlay and hides while one is up, terminal zoom, and the dashboard.
  The daemon ignores a session switch while its leader is managed: the client's nonce, its generation and
  what it reads and types through the daemon are all bound to that one session. Taking the lead is always a FRESH attach into a
  new surface, by the first key on the cover, by `session.lead`, or by itself when the role turns
  `unowned`. The automatic one omits the claim, so it leads only if the daemon is still unowned when it
  arrives and cannot take a lead someone claimed meanwhile. In place repair was rejected: libghostty
  reports a new grid before its terminal has it, and the role report reaches the app a main-queue hop
  after the bytes behind it, so a replay could be parsed at the old grid.
- `agtermApp.reattachPane` runs none of the pane's close paths: session, daemon and pane identity stay,
  so the program keeps its `AGTERM_PANE_ID`. The cover stays up from the swap until the new client's
  first report. An open search owned by the old surface is cleared synchronously, since END_SEARCH
  answers through a callback `destroySurface` clears first; a dashboard cell's transient font is carried
  as the override and never seeds the new surface's own size. `remotePaneStopped` drops the pane's
  lead state when an attach ends on its exit prompt or waits to reconnect, a failed take-over included,
  or the cover would hide the line saying what died and swallow the key that closes it. The launch
  attaches and never creates: a trailing `/bin/sh -c` fails when the daemon is gone, locally as for an
  attached pane, so a vanished session ends the pane. An attached pane is
  rebuilt from `RemoteBinding.Origin`, never from the pane's first command line, which carries that
  attachment's nonce.
- The takeover key is consumed with its repeats and its release, and a Command chord on a covered pane
  is swallowed without taking the lead. Paste, drop, IME and mouse need no app-side guard: the daemon
  drops a managed follower's input.
- The role the app holds is a REPORT, a main-queue hop and up to 250 ms behind the daemon, so it never
  decides delivery. For a LOCAL pane, after its zmx's first role report, `session.type` ALWAYS goes through
  `zmx type`, which queues bytes without the lead and acknowledges them, and `surface.cursor` plus
  `session.text --all`/`--lines` are ALWAYS answered by `zmx screen`, the daemon's own terminal, which
  has the leader's layout. Keying these on the cached role answered ok for input the daemon had already
  started dropping. This is what keeps pane-to-pane automation, the chat transport included, working on
  the Mac a session runs on while another Mac leads it. A failed daemon call is an error, never a fall
  back to the surface. The main pane's realize poll repeats the check before each inject.
- Accepted limit: between a local pane's attach and its first role report the pane types through its
  surface, so a `session.type` there can answer ok for input a daemon led from another Mac drops. The
  window is one pane spawn plus the report lag. Probing `zmx type` before every call was rejected: a
  daemon from a build predating the patch never reports and ignores the `Type` tag, so each call to it
  would time out again.
- `zmx type` is keystrokes, not bytes and not a paste: `session.type` sends each line ending as one CR
  and the daemon encodes every CR as a Return press and release, and every run between them as typed
  text, with Ghostty's own key encoder against its terminal's LIVE keyboard mode. A program that asked
  for the kitty protocol therefore gets `CSI 13 u` and the release where a shell gets a bare CR, exactly
  as `inject`'s key events do; a fixed CR was wrong for every such program in an ordinary live pane.
  A pending IME composition is sent FIRST on the same acknowledged call and dropped locally only once
  the daemon took it: committing it through the surface would race the scripted line or be dropped.
- The default `session.text` is the one read whose meaning is the pane's own scrolled viewport, so it
  stays on the surface while the pane leads and moves to the daemon only while it is covered. That read
  alone keeps the one-hop window after a demotion.
- Commands that act on the pane's OWN surface are refused while it is covered, with `pane is covered
  while another Mac leads it; take the lead first (session lead)`: `session.paste`, `.selectall`, `.copy`,
  and a `session.search` that opens, updates or navigates, judged on the PINNED `searchSurface` when a
  search is open. They would otherwise answer ok for a paste the daemon drops or select text laid out
  for another grid. `session.search --to close` stays available, being cleanup. A pane that leads keeps
  the native action and its read-back and NO delivery acknowledgement, the role report trailing the
  daemon by up to 250 ms; paste is not routed through `zmx type`, which is keystrokes and would lose
  bracketed paste.
- A covered pane ATTACHED from another Mac refuses all three with `pane is in use on the Mac it runs
  on; take the lead to drive it from here`: its daemon is an ssh away and these reads are synchronous.
- `session.lead [--pane]` is the control twin of the cover's key. A pane that already leads answers ok;
  one with no reported role answers `pane has no lead to take`; scratch is refused. Read back `lead`.
  It has no menu item or chord: the cover is its GUI surface.
- The far side runs the ORIGIN's zmx, so both Macs need the patch. Against an older origin nothing is
  reported, no pane is covered, and the pre-patch behaviour holds: the attach follows until a typed key.

## Session backgrounds

- `session.background image|text|color|clear` persists a host-free `BackgroundWatermark`.
  Image requires existing PNG/JPEG path without controls. Text is capped at 256 characters and may set
  color. Image/text accept opacity 0...1, typed fit, position, and repeats. Color requires `#rrggbb` and
  uses window opacity, not a per-call value.
- Apply to main, split, and scratch through retained per-surface config overlays. Image/text force
  background opacity 1; solid color emits background plus current window opacity; include font size so
  session zoom survives. Free configs only when surfaces die.
- Text rasterizes under `<stateDir>/watermarks/<sessionID>.png` with live foreground default. Regenerate on
  restore/theme change; remove on clear, text-to-image, and permanent deletion.
- Shared config reload wipes surface overlays, so resolve theme colors then reapply. Opacity-slider changes
  must reapply color after `windowOpacity` updates, including within-range drags that do not reload.
- `Fit`/`Position` are CaseIterable typed enums. Revalidate free-text path/color during emission.
  Tree reads the stored background specification. See [[libghostty]] for live OSC 11 precedence.
- `--pane left|right|scratch` writes a per-pane override (`Session.paneBackgrounds`) over the session
  default; a pane renders `override ?? default`, so the scratch keeps inheriting (#274). Set and clear
  without `--pane` touch only the default; a pane clear returns that pane to inheriting.
  Right needs `hasSplit`, scratch a live scratch surface; otherwise the request fails.
- Overrides follow the terminal: `swapPanes` swaps left/right, `closePrimaryPane` promotes right to left,
  `closeSplit` and `closeScratch` drop theirs. Left/right persist; scratch never does.
  Text overrides render to `<sessionID>-<pane identity|scratch>.png`, removed with their pane.
- A pane set applies to that surface only; a default change re-applies only inheriting panes, since
  re-applying clears an overridden pane's OSC 11 latch. Tree `paneBackgrounds` lists overrides only,
  never effective values, omitted when none.
- Washes blend toward the pane's own solid color (`Session.washColorHex(for:)`). The floating backdrop
  paints `backdropWashRegions` opaque and fades the group once, so no pane is muted twice.
